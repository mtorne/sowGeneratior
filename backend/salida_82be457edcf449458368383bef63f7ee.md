**Tech Stack**: Docker, Helm, PostgreSQL, Java
**Known Issues/Pain Points**: Manual deployments, scaling issues, limited resources


# 16. Target OCI Architecture
The target architecture will utilize the following OCI services:
- Openshift Cluster for containerized deployment
- GPU VM for compute-intensive tasks
- Oracle 19c on IaaS for database management

**Service Mapping**:
| Current Service | Target OCI Service |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| On-prem OpenShift | Openshift Cluster  |
| Kafka            | OCI Streaming      |
| PostgreSQL       | Oracle 19c on IaaS |

**Component Interaction**:
- WERX application will be deployed on Openshift Cluster
- GPU VM will be used for compute-intensive tasks
- Oracle 19c on IaaS will manage the database

**Diagram Placeholder**: A high-level diagram will be provided, showing the interaction between the components.


# 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings
- **Openshift Cluster**: 3 master nodes, 3 worker nodes, with auto-scaling enabled

# 18. Security Considerations
- IAM policies will be used to control access to resources
- NSG configuration will be implemented to restrict inbound and outbound traffic
- Data encryption will be used for data at rest and in transit
- Audit logs will be configured to monitor and analyze security events


# 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
- OKE NodePools will be spread across multiple availability domains
- PostgreSQL will be configured for high availability using Oracle RAC
- Object Storage will be used for backups and disaster recovery
