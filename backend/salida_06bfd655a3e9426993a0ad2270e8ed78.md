# 5. Project Framework
This Statement of Work outlines the collaboration between Oracle and Tecnotree for validating the Digital BSS Solution on OCI. Oracle will lead the architecture design, deployment, and validation using OCI services, while Tecnotree provides application-specific expertise, artifacts, and testing support. Responsibility areas include: Oracle handling OCI infrastructure setup and best practices; Tecnotree managing application deployment and functional testing. Feedback loops will involve weekly status meetings and iterative reviews of architecture and deployment artifacts. The expected validation duration is 2-3 weeks, focusing on a lift-and-shift approach with potential cloud-native optimizations.

---


# 6. Required Contribution From Client
Tecnotree must provide the following to ensure successful validation:
- **Technical resources**: Dedicated personnel (e.g., architects and developers) for collaboration, including access to application code, container images, and configuration files.
- **Diagrams or architectural artifacts**: Current state architecture diagrams, data flow models, and dependency mappings for the Digital BSS Solution.
- **Access to dev/test environment**: Credentials and endpoints for existing on-prem or cloud environments to replicate setups, including sample data for testing and any required licenses for third-party components.

---


# 7. Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs
Oracle will deliver:
- **Terraform modules**: Reusable code for provisioning OCI resources, including OKE clusters, networking, and storage.
- **Target architecture in OCI**: Detailed diagrams and descriptions of the validated architecture using specified OCI services.
- **Technical documentation**: Step-by-step deployment guides, configuration settings, and best practices for integration.
- **CI/CD integration examples**: Sample pipelines using OCI Container Registry and Terraform for automated deployments, if relevant to the validation scope.

---


# 8. Cloud Environment Used
The PoC will run in a **Temporary Test Tenancy** provided by Oracle, configured in the Frankfurt region for low-latency testing. This setup allows for isolated validation without impacting Tecnotree's production environments. If Tecnotree is already onboarded, migration to their tenancy can be considered post-validation.

# 11. Project Overview
**Validation Summary**: Validation of Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using a Lift & Shift approach. The goal is to assess the compatibility of the existing containerized application architecture (Kubernetes, OKE) with OCI’s managed services, including database, storage, networking, and security. The validation will include functional testing, automated deployment using Terraform, and the definition of a target OCI architecture based on best practices.  
**Project Dates**:  
- Kick-off Version Date: May 28, 2025  
- Latest Update / Current Version: June 4, 2025  
- Estimated Project Duration: 2–3 weeks  

**Project Team**:  
**Oracle Team**:  
- Heikki Ridanpaa – Account Cloud Engineer  
- Maria Solvsteen – Sales Representative  
- Marc Torné – Cloud Solution Architect  
- Laura Taunasescu – Service Delivery Manager  

**Tecnotree Team**:  
- Markus Kivilä – Senior Enterprise Architect  
- Suhail Thusu – Director – Technology Alliances  
- Hannu Vuori – Enterprise Architect  

- **Desired outcome**: To be provided by Tecnotree and then agreed together with Oracle. If the SoW is filled in separately, Tecnotree can add the desired outcome and then synch with Oracle. Any change in the objectives and scope of the work will require mutual agreement between Tecnotree and Oracle.  
- **Initial understanding of the scope**: Needs to be validated with Tecnotree. Replicating the customer’s environment in a pay-as-you-go tenancy in Frankfurt to enable functional testing of Tecnotree's containerized Kubernetes setup. The focus is on a lift-and-shift approach without managed services, using a multi-node OKE cluster and supporting components like databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra) and UI servers, with specific latency and connectivity needs.  
- **Desired outcome of Tecnotree**: Successfully validate their application stack in a replicated, containerized environment on OCI that mirrors the customer’s setup. This includes ensuring functional compatibility, performance within latency requirements, and readiness for future automation or cloud-native enhancements—ultimately enabling a smooth lift-and-shift migration path for customer environments.  
- **Desired Outcome, as jointly agreed with Oracle**: Demonstrate that OCI can reliably host Tecnotree’s containerized workloads in a way that matches customer requirements, including performance, scalability, and connectivity (e.g., to external systems).  
- **Scope boundaries**: Limited to dev/test validation; no production migration.  
- **Joint goals**: Achieve seamless integration, identify optimization opportunities, and document a migration blueprint.

# 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


 1. Networking
- **VCN design, CIDRs, Subnets**: VCN with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16; public subnet (10.0.0.0/24) for Load Balancer and Bastion; private subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for OKE and databases; dedicated subnet for VPN (10.0.2.0/24).
- **Internet/NAT Gateways, Service Gateways**: Internet Gateway for public access; NAT Gateway for private outbound; Service Gateway for OCI services like Container Registry.
- **Local Peering Gateways (LPGs)**: LPG for cross-VCN peering if multi-region setup is needed.
- **Route tables, security lists, NSGs**: Route tables direct traffic to NAT/Internet; NSGs restrict OKE ports (e.g., 6443 for API, 10250 for nodes); Security Lists allow VPN ingress.



 2. Compute
- **VM shapes and OCPUs/memory**: VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs and 64 GB memory for general nodes; scalable to 8 OCPUs for high-load instances.
- **OS and images used**: Oracle Linux 8 for base images, customized with application dependencies.
- **Bastion/jump hosts**: Bastion host using VM.Standard.E5.Flex in public subnet for secure SSH to private resources.
- **GPU instances (if any)**: Not applicable; standard E5 shapes used.



 3. Storage
- **Block Volumes, Object Storage**: Block Volumes (500 GB, balanced performance) attached to Compute instances for databases; Object Storage for backups.
- **Boot volume size and configuration**: 100 GB boot volumes with encryption enabled.
- **File Storage**: NFS-based File Storage (1 TB) mounted on OKE for shared application data, with snapshots for backups.



 4. Container Services
- **OKE deployment process**: Deploy via OCI Console or Terraform; use Helm for app installation on multi-node cluster (3 worker nodes, E5 shapes).
- **Integration with OCI**: Terraform for provisioning; Container Registry for pushing/pulling Docker images; OCI Cache integrated for session data.



 5. IAM & Security
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartment for validation resources (e.g., "Tecnotree-BSS-Validation").
- **IAM policies**: Policies allowing OKE to access Container Registry (e.g., allow group OKE-Admins to manage repos).
- **Use of resource tags**: Tags for cost tracking (e.g., Project: BSS-Validation, Environment: Test).
- **Access control via NSGs or Security Lists**: NSGs for fine-grained control (e.g., allow 443 from Load Balancer to OKE).



 6. Deployment Automation
- **Terraform/Resource Manager usage**: Terraform modules to provision VCN, OKE, MySQL, etc.; Resource Manager stacks for orchestration.
- **CLI or Console steps**: OCI CLI for initial setup (e.g., oci network vcn create); Console for WAF policy configuration.
- **Additional services**: OCI Streaming configured via Terraform; MySQL Database Service with high availability; self-managed MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute VMs; Load Balancer with WAF rules; VPN for site-to-site connectivity.

📌 **Additional Notes**: Deployment sequence starts with VCN/IAM, followed by Compute/OKE, then storage/databases, and finally networking/security integrations. Use concise Terraform code snippets in docs for reproducibility.

---


# 18. Security Considerations
- **IAM Policy examples**: Dynamic group for OKE nodes with policy: ALLOW DYNAMIC-GROUP OKE-Nodes TO READ all-resources IN COMPARTMENT Tecnotree-BSS; user groups for read-only access to monitoring.  
- **NSG configuration**: Ingress rules for port 80/443 from Load Balancer; egress to MySQL on 3306; restricted to specific CIDRs for VPN/Bastion.  
- **Data encryption approach**: OCI-managed keys for Block Storage and File Storage; encryption in transit via TLS for MySQL and Streaming; at-rest encryption for all databases.  
- **Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup**: Enable OCI Logging for audit trails; integrate with Logging Analytics for centralized querying of OKE and Compute logs.

---


# 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
High Availability (HA) in OCI is achieved through multi-Availability Domain (AD) deployments, fault-tolerant services, and automated failover mechanisms. Disaster Recovery (DR) focuses on cross-region replication, backups, and defined RPO/RTO to minimize downtime.

- **OKE**: Node Pools distributed across multiple ADs or Fault Domains (FDs) for resilience; use of 3+ nodes with auto-scaling to handle failures.  
- **Database Services (e.g., MySQL Database Service)**: HA via active-passive replicas across ADs; OCI-managed failover with Data Guard-like features; multi-AD deployment for zero-downtime maintenance. MongoDB/Cassandra self-managed with replicas across ADs for data durability.  
- **Block Storage/File Storage**: Cross-AD replication for volumes; automated snapshots with RPO of 1 hour.  
- **Load Balancer/WAF**: Deployed across multiple ADs with health checks for failover.  
- **OCI Streaming/OCI Cache**: Multi-AD topics and clusters for HA; replication for DR.  
- **Networking & DNS**: VCN with redundant gateways; VPN with multiple tunnels for HA.  
- **Backup & Restore**: Policy-based backups for Compute, OKE, and databases; RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour via Volume Group Backups.  
- **DR Strategy Summary**: Active-passive DR across regions (e.g., Frankfurt to Amsterdam); region failover via manual switchover; testing via simulated failures; expected recovery time < 2 hours for critical components.
