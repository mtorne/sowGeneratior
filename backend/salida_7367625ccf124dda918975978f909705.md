- Internet Gateway for external access.  

---


# 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings  



 **Networking**  
- **VCN Design**: Single VCN with public and private subnets.  
- **CIDRs**: 10.0.0.0/16 (Public: 10.0.1.0/24, Private: 10.0.2.0/24).  
- **Gateways**: Internet Gateway for public access, NAT Gateway for private instances.  
- **Security**: NSGs to restrict traffic between subnets.  



 **Compute**  
- **VM Shapes**: E5.Flex (4 OCPUs, 16 GB RAM) for MySQL.  
- **OS**: Oracle Linux 8.  
- **Bastion Host**: E5.Flex (2 OCPUs, 8 GB RAM) for secure access.  



 **Storage**  
- **Block Volumes**: 500 GB for MySQL data.  
- **Boot Volume**: 100 GB for MySQL VM.  



 **Container Services**  
- **OKE**: 3-node cluster with worker nodes in separate ADs.  
- **Integration**: OCI Resource Manager for cluster deployment.  



 **IAM & Security**  
- **Compartments**: Separate compartments for OKE and MySQL.  
- **IAM Policies**: Restrict access to resources based on roles.  



 **Deployment Automation**  
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure-as-code for VCN, OKE, and MySQL.  

---


# 18. Security Considerations  
- **IAM Policies**: Limit access to OCI resources based on role.  
- **NSG Configuration**: Restrict inbound/outbound traffic to necessary ports.  
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS).  
- **Logging**: Enable Audit Logs for resource changes.  

---


# 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery  
**Principles**:  
- Distribute resources across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) for HA.  
- Use cross-region replication for DR.  

**OKE**:  
- Multi-node cluster across ADs for fault tolerance.  

**MySQL on IaaS**:  
- Manual backups to Object Storage for DR.  

**DR Strategy**:  
- RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 4 hours.
