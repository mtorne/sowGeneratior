 Current State Architecture

The current dd application is deployed on an on-premises or third-party cloud Kubernetes cluster. It consists of:  
- Containerized microservices using Docker.  
- Basic networking with load balancers.  
- Storage via persistent volumes.  
- Limited HA through manual replicas.  
Challenges include scalability bottlenecks and lack of native cloud integrations.


 Target OCI Architecture

The target architecture lifts and shifts dd to OCI OKE, an OCI-native managed Kubernetes service. OKE provides automated cluster management, scalability, and integration with OCI services for enhanced security and HA.


# Usage of OCI Services: OKE
- **OKE:** Used for orchestrating dd containers across worker nodes in multiple Availability Domains (ADs) for HA. Clusters are configured with auto-scaling node pools using E5 shapes for cost-effective, high-performance compute.


# Service Mapping Table

| Current Component | OCI Service | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Kubernetes Cluster | OKE | Managed Kubernetes for lift and shift with OCI integrations |
| Worker Nodes | Compute Instances (E5 shapes) | Flexible, scalable VMs for container workloads |
| Networking | Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) | Secure, isolated networking |
| Storage | Block Volume | Persistent storage for stateful applications |


# Component Interaction
- dd pods are deployed on OKE worker nodes (E5 shapes).  
- Traffic flows through OCI Load Balancer to OKE services.  
- Storage is attached via OCI Block Volumes for persistent data.  
- Monitoring via OCI Logging and Metrics for scalability insights.

 Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# Networking
- **VCN Configuration:** Single VCN with public and private subnets across 3 ADs. CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16.  
- **Security Lists:** Ingress/egress rules restricted to dd ports (e.g., 80, 443).  
- **Load Balancer:** OCI Flexible Load Balancer for traffic distribution to OKE services.


# Compute
- **Instance Shapes:** E5.Standard (AMD-based) for OKE worker nodes, providing up to 64 OCPU and 1TB memory for scalability.  
- **Scaling:** Auto-scaling groups configured to handle load spikes.


# Storage
- **Block Volumes:** 100GB volumes with automatic backups, attached to OKE pods via Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).  
- **File Storage:** Optional FSS for shared access if needed.


# Container Services
- **OKE Cluster:** Version 1.28, with 3 worker nodes initially, auto-scaling to 10.  
- **Helm Charts:** Used for deploying dd manifests on OKE.


# IAM & Security
- **Policies:** Least-privilege IAM policies for OKE access.  
- **Vault Integration:** OCI Vault for secret management in pods.


# Deployment Automation
- **Terraform:** Modules for provisioning OKE, VCN, and resources. CI/CD readiness with GitHub Actions integration.  
- **Example Snippet:** `resource "oci_containerengine_cluster" "dd_oke" { ... }`


 Security Considerations

Security is paramount, following OCI best practices:  
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Dynamic groups and policies to restrict OKE access.  
- **Encryption:** Data at rest encrypted with OCI Vault keys; in-transit via TLS 1.3.  
- **Network Security:** Bastion hosts for access, WAF for web traffic.  
- **Compliance:** Alignment with CIS benchmarks; regular vulnerability scanning via OCI Vulnerability Scanning Service.  
- **Monitoring:** OCI Security Advisor for proactive threat detection.


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

Tailored to OKE, the HA/DR strategy leverages OCI's multi-AD/FD architecture:  
- **HA Patterns:** OKE nodes spread across 3 ADs for fault tolerance; auto-scaling and self-healing.  
- **Failover:** OCI Traffic Management for cross-region routing if extended.  
- **Backups:** Automated snapshots of Block Volumes; OKE etcd backups.  
- **DR:** Cross-region replication of container images in OCI Container Registry; recovery time objective (RTO) <1 hour.  
- **Testing:** Simulated failover tests to ensure 99.99% availability.


 Closing Feedback

Oracle ISV Labs appreciates the opportunity to collaborate with dd on this OCI validation. This lift and shift to OKE demonstrates significant benefits in scalability, security, and automation. We welcome feedback to refine future engagements.
