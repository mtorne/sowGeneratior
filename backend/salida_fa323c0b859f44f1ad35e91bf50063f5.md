- **Lift & Shift Approach**: Migrate Tecnotree’s containerized Digital BSS Solution to OCI without major code changes.
- **OCI Best Practices**: Emphasize OCI-native features for security (e.g., IAM policies, WAF), HA (e.g., multi-AD deployments), scalability (e.g., auto-scaling in OKE), and automation (e.g., Terraform for IaC).
- **Project Duration**: Estimated 2–3 weeks, from kick-off on May 28, 2025, to completion by June 18–25, 2025.
- **Collaboration Model**: Joint workshops, weekly status calls, and shared access to OCI tenancy for testing.
- **Assumptions**: Tecnotree provides container images and Kubernetes manifests; Oracle handles OCI provisioning.


 Required Contribution From Client

Tecnotree is expected to contribute the following:
- Provide detailed documentation of the current Digital BSS Solution architecture, including containerized components, database schemas, and networking requirements.
- Supply container images to OCI Container Registry and Kubernetes deployment manifests.
- Participate in joint testing sessions, including functional validation and performance benchmarking.
- Allocate team members (e.g., Markus Kivilä, Hannu Vuori) for workshops and reviews.
- Share any existing CI/CD pipelines for integration with Terraform automation.
- Cover any client-side costs, such as data transfer fees.


 Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs

Oracle ISV Labs will deliver:
- **Target OCI Architecture Document**: Including diagrams, service mappings, and best practices recommendations.

 Current State Architecture

Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution is currently deployed on-premises or in another cloud using Kubernetes clusters. It includes microservices for billing and analytics, with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra for data storage. Networking relies on standard VPN and load balancers, with file/block storage for persistent data. The architecture lacks OCI-native optimizations, such as managed Kubernetes (OKE) or integrated streaming (OCI Streaming).


 Target OCI Architecture

The target architecture migrates the Digital BSS Solution to an OCI-native setup, leveraging managed services for efficiency. It emphasizes security through IAM and WAF, HA via multi-AD deployments, scalability with auto-scaling, and automation via Terraform.


# Usage of OCI Services
- **Compute**: E5 shapes (e.g., VM.Standard.E5.Flex) for virtual machines hosting non-containerized components.
- **OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)**: Managed Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized BSS microservices.
- **Block Storage**: Persistent volumes for stateful workloads like databases.
- **File Storage**: Shared file systems for application logs and configurations.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to OKE pods with health checks.
- **WAF**: Protects against web threats at the edge.
- **OCI Cache**: In-memory caching for performance optimization (e.g., Redis-compatible).
- **MySQL Database Service**: Managed MySQL for relational data.
- **MongoDB**: Integrated via OCI-compatible services or self-managed on Compute for NoSQL storage.
- **Cassandra**: Deployed on OKE or Compute for distributed NoSQL.
- **OCI Streaming**: For real-time data processing and event-driven architecture.
- **Container Registry**: Stores and manages Docker images for BSS components.
- **Bastion**: Secure jump hosts for administrative access.
- **VPN**: Site-to-Site VPN for connecting on-premises to OCI VCN.
- **VCN**: Virtual Cloud Network for isolated networking.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management for role-based access control.

# Component Interaction
BSS microservices in OKE interact with MySQL/MongoDB/Cassandra via VCN peering. Traffic flows through Load Balancer and WAF for security. OCI Streaming handles events, with OCI Cache accelerating queries. Bastion and VPN enable secure access, all governed by IAM policies. Compute instances (E5) support auxiliary services, with storage mounted via Block/File Storage.

 Security Considerations

Security is prioritized with OCI best practices:
- **IAM Policies**: Least-privilege access, e.g., OKE workers granted read-only to Container Registry.
- **Encryption**: Data at rest (Block Storage) and in transit (TLS 1.3) using OCI Vault keys.
- **WAF and Networking**: Edge protection against DDoS/SQL injection; VCN security lists to restrict traffic.
- **Bastion and VPN**: MFA-enabled access, audit logging enabled.
- **Compliance**: Alignment with OCI's shared responsibility model, including vulnerability scanning in Container Registry.


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

The architecture ensures HA and DR tailored to services:
- **Compute & OKE**: Deploy across multiple ADs/Fault Domains (FDs) with auto-scaling; OKE control plane is managed for 99.95% uptime.
- **Storage**: Block Storage with automatic backups and cross-region replication; File Storage snapshots for point-in-time recovery.
- **Load Balancer & WAF**: Regional anycast IPs for failover; traffic management with health checks.
- **Databases**: MySQL Database Service with HA replicas across ADs; MongoDB/Cassandra in replicated clusters on OKE.
- **OCI Streaming & Cache**: Partitioned streams with replication; Cache with eviction policies.
- **Networking**: VCN with redundant gateways; VPN with active-passive failover.
- **IAM & Bastion**: No single points of failure; policies replicated via groups.
- **DR Strategy**: Cross-region asynchronous replication for critical data, with RTO < 4 hours and RPO < 1 hour using OCI backups and Traffic Management Steering Policies.


 Closing Feedback

This SoW provides a comprehensive plan for validating Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on OCI. Feedback from Tecnotree is welcome to refine details. Upon validation, Oracle recommends scaling to production with OCI's full suite for enhanced telecom operations.
