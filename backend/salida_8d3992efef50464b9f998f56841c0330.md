 5. Project Framework
This collaboration between Oracle and Tecnotree follows a structured validation process for the Digital BSS Solution on OCI. Oracle will lead the architecture design, deployment, and testing, while Tecnotree provides application expertise, artifacts, and validation criteria. Responsibility areas include: Oracle handling OCI configuration and best practices; Tecnotree managing application-specific customizations. Feedback loops involve weekly status meetings and iterative reviews of architecture and test results. The expected validation duration is 2-3 weeks, focusing on a lift-and-shift approach with potential cloud-native optimizations.

---


 6. Required Contribution From Client
Tecnotree must provide the following to ensure successful validation:
- **Technical resources**: Dedicated architects and developers for joint sessions, application code, and container images.
- **Diagrams or architectural artifacts**: Current state architecture diagrams, data flow models, and deployment scripts (e.g., Helm charts for Kubernetes).
- **Access to dev/test environment**: Credentials and endpoints for on-prem or existing cloud setups to replicate workloads, including sample data for testing databases and streaming services.

---


 7. Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs
Oracle will deliver:
- **Terraform modules**: Reusable code for provisioning OCI resources like OKE, VCN, and databases.
- **Target architecture in OCI**: Detailed diagrams and configurations for the validated setup.
- **Technical documentation**: Step-by-step deployment guides, security configurations, and performance benchmarks.
- **CI/CD integration examples**: Sample pipelines using OCI Container Registry and Terraform for automated deployments.

---


 8. Cloud Environment Used
The PoC will run in a **Temporary Test Tenancy** provided by Oracle, configured in the Frankfurt region for low-latency testing. This tenancy will be pay-as-you-go and isolated from production environments. If Tecnotree is already onboarded, validation can shift to their tenancy upon request.

 11. Project Overview
**Validation Summary**: Validation of Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using a Lift & Shift approach. The goal is to assess the compatibility of the existing containerized application architecture (Kubernetes, OKE) with OCI’s managed services, including database, storage, networking, and security. The validation will include functional testing, automated deployment using Terraform, and the definition of a target OCI architecture based on best practices.

**Project Dates**:
- Kick-off Version Date: May 28, 2025
- Latest Update / Current Version: June 4, 2025
- Estimated Project Duration: 2–3 weeks

**Project Team**:
- **Oracle Team**:
  - Heikki Ridanpaa – Account Cloud Engineer
  - Maria Solvsteen – Sales Representative
  - Marc Torné – Cloud Solution Architect
  - Laura Taunasescu – Service Delivery Manager
- **Tecnotree Team**:
  - Markus Kivilä – Senior Enterprise Architect
  - Suhail Thusu – Director – Technology Alliances

- **Desired outcome**: To be provided by Tecnotree and then agreed together with Oracle. If the SoW is filled in separately, Tecnotree can add the desired outcome and then synch with Oracle. Any change in the objectives and scope of the work will require mutual agreement between Tecnotree and Oracle.

- **Initial understanding of the scope - needs to be validated with Tecnotree**: Replicating the customer’s environment in a pay-as-you-go tenancy in Frankfurt to enable functional testing of Tecnotree's containerized OpenShift setup. The focus is on a lift-and-shift approach without managed services, using a 6-node OpenShift cluster and supporting components like a database (Oracle 19c) and UI servers, with specific latency and connectivity needs.

- **Desired outcome of Tecnotree**: Successfully validate their application stack in a replicated, containerized environment on OCI that mirrors the customer’s setup. This includes ensuring functional compatibility, performance within latency requirements, and readiness for future automation or cloud-native enhancements—ultimately enabling a smooth lift-and-shift migration path for customer environments.

- **Desired Outcome, as jointly agreed with Oracle**: Demonstrate that OCI can reliably host Tecnotree’s containerized workloads in a way that matches customer requirements, including performance, scalability, and connectivity (e.g., to PLCs).

- **Scope boundaries**: Limited to dev/test validation; no production migration.
- **Joint goals**: Achieve seamless integration with OCI services, document best practices, and identify optimization opportunities.

- **Tech Stack**: Docker, Helm, PostgreSQL (similar to MySQL), Java/Spring Boot, Kafka, MongoDB, Cassandra.
- **Known Issues/Pain Points**: Manual deployments leading to downtime, scaling issues during peak loads, and limited HA without automated failover.

---


 16. Target OCI Architecture
The target architecture lifts and shifts the Digital BSS Solution to OCI, leveraging **OKE** for container orchestration, **Compute** for VMs, **Block Storage** and **File Storage** for persistent data, **Load Balancer** and **WAF** for traffic management and security, **OCI Cache** for performance, **MySQL Database Service**, **MongoDB** (via Compute), **Cassandra** (via Compute), **OCI Streaming** for messaging, **Container Registry** for images, **Bastion** and **VPN** for secure access, **VCN** for networking, and **IAM** for access control. This ensures scalability, security, and HA.

- **Service Mapping Table**:
  | Current Component | OCI Service Mapping                  |
  |-------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | Kubernetes Cluster| OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)       |
  | VMs/Servers       | Compute (E5 shapes)                  |
  | Persistent Storage| Block Storage, File Storage          |
  | Load Balancing    | Load Balancer, WAF                   |
  | Caching           | OCI Cache                            |
  | Relational DB     | MySQL Database Service               |
  | NoSQL DB          | MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute         |
  | Messaging         | OCI Streaming                        |
  | Image Registry    | Container Registry                   |
  | Secure Access     | Bastion, VPN                         |
  | Networking        | VCN                                  |
  | Identity          | IAM                                  |

- **Component Interaction**: Apps in OKE pods interact with MySQL/MongoDB/Cassandra via internal VCN endpoints. OCI Streaming handles real-time data flows, cached by OCI Cache. Load Balancer routes traffic protected by WAF. Bastion and VPN enable secure admin access. IAM enforces least-privilege policies.
- **Diagram Placeholder**: Text description - A central VCN with public/private subnets; OKE cluster in private subnet spanning 3 ADs; Databases in dedicated subnets; Load Balancer in public subnet fronting WAF; Storage attached to Compute instances; VPN connecting to on-prem; Bastion for SSH.

 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# 1. Networking
- **VCN design, CIDRs, Subnets**: VCN with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16; public subnet (10.0.0.0/24) for Load Balancer; private subnets (10.0.1.0/24 for OKE, 10.0.2.0/24 for databases).
- **Internet/NAT Gateways, Service Gateways**: Internet Gateway for public access; NAT Gateway for private outbound; Service Gateway for OCI services like Object Storage.
- **Local Peering Gateways (LPGs)**: LPG for inter-VCN peering if multi-tenancy needed.
- **Route tables, security lists, NSGs**: Route tables direct traffic to gateways; NSGs restrict OKE ports (e.g., 80/443 inbound); Security Lists allow VPN traffic on 1194 UDP.


# 2. Compute
- **VM shapes and OCPUs/memory**: VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs and 64 GB memory for general workloads; scaled to 8 OCPUs for database hosts.
- **OS and images used**: Oracle Linux 8 for all instances; custom images from Container Registry for app-specific needs.
- **Bastion/jump hosts**: Bastion service with session-based SSH access to private instances.
- **GPU instances (if any)**: Not applicable.


# 3. Storage
- **Block Volumes, Object Storage**: Block Volumes (500 GB, 100 VPUs) attached to Compute for databases; Object Storage for backups.
- **Boot volume size and configuration**: 100 GB boot volumes with auto-tuning enabled.
- File Storage mounted on OKE nodes for shared app data (e.g., /mnt/shared, 1 TB).


# 4. Container Services
- **OKE deployment process**: Deploy OKE cluster with 3 worker nodes (E5 shapes) using OCI Console or Terraform; integrate with Container Registry for image pulls.
- **Integration with OCI**: Use Resource Manager for stack deployment; push images to Container Registry via OCI CLI.
- Helm charts for app deployment on OKE, with OCI Streaming as Kafka alternative.


# 5. IAM & Security
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartments for networking, compute, storage, and databases.
- **IAM policies**: Policies like "allow group Admins to manage all-resources in compartment BSS" (optional, dynamic groups for OKE).
- **Use of resource tags**: Tags for cost tracking (e.g., Project=BSS-Validation).
- **Access control via NSGs or Security Lists**: NSGs for fine-grained control (e.g., allow 3306 from OKE to MySQL).


# 6. Deployment Automation
- **Terraform/Resource Manager usage**: Terraform modules for provisioning VCN, OKE, Load Balancer; applied via Resource Manager stacks.
- **CLI or Console steps**: OCI CLI for initial setup (e.g., oci network vcn create); Console for WAF policy creation.
- Image upload to Container Registry; automated OKE node provisioning.

**Additional Notes**: Deployment sequence starts with VCN, followed by Compute/Bastion, then OKE and databases, integrated via Terraform. Inter-service: OKE pulls from Container Registry, streams to OCI Streaming, secured by IAM and NSGs.

---


 18. Security Considerations
- **IAM Policy examples**: "allow service OKE to read repos in tenancy" for Container Registry access; "allow group BSS-Admins to manage instances in compartment Compute".
- **NSG configuration**: Stateful rules allowing inbound 443 from Load Balancer to OKE; egress to MySQL on 3306.
- **Data encryption approach**: OCI-managed keys for Block Storage (AES-256); encryption at rest for MySQL Database Service; transit encryption via TLS 1.3 for all services.
- **Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup**: Enable OCI Logging for audit trails; integrate with Logging Analytics for centralized querying of IAM events and WAF logs.

---


 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
High Availability (HA) in OCI is achieved by distributing resources across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) and Fault Domains (FDs) to mitigate single points of failure. Disaster Recovery (DR) leverages cross-region replication and automated backups to ensure business continuity with defined RPO/RTO.

- **OKE**: Node Pools distributed across 3 ADs/FDs for resilience; auto-scaling and self-healing pods ensure 99.95% uptime.
- **Database Services (e.g., MySQL Database Service)**: HA with active-passive replicas across ADs; OCI-managed failover for MySQL; multi-AD deployment for MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute instances.
- **Block Storage/File Storage**: Cross-AD replication for volumes; automated snapshots with 1-hour RPO.
- **Load Balancer**: Active-active setup across ADs with health checks; integrated with WAF for traffic failover.
- **OCI Streaming/OCI Cache**: Multi-AD partitions for Streaming; Cache replicas for redundancy.
- **Networking & DNS**: VCN with redundant gateways; VPN with dual tunnels for HA.
- **Backup & Restore**: Daily backups for Compute/MySQL with 4-hour RTO; manual restore testing.
- **DR Strategy Summary**: Active-passive DR to a secondary region (e.g., Amsterdam from Frankfurt) with data replication via Object Storage; failover in under 2 hours; quarterly testing procedures.
