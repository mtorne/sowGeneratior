# 5. Project Framework
This section outlines the working model, shared responsibilities, deliverables, and infrastructure requirements for the validation project between Oracle ISV Labs and **Tecnotree**. The engagement is focused on the application validation stage only and does not include production workloads.



 5.1 Objective and Scope  
The goal of this collaboration is to validate the application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), assess its compatibility, and define a target architecture. Oracle ISV Labs will provide deployment tooling, infrastructure recommendations, and technical guidance during this process.  
**Note:** No intellectual property will be transferred during the engagement.



 5.2 Collaboration Model  
Both Oracle and **Tecnotree** will actively participate throughout the engagement. Clear communication channels and shared ownership will be established to ensure progress and alignment.

- The project will formally begin upon sign-off of the Statement of Work (SoW).
- Status updates will be shared on a regular basis to ensure that timelines and dependencies are met.



 5.3 Responsibility Domains  
Responsibility for document inputs and project actions will be clearly delineated:

- **Oracle (Tan areas)**: Provides architectural guidance, Terraform automation, and technical documentation.
- **Tecnotree (Green areas)**: Supplies required architecture diagrams, technical points of contact, and necessary environment access.



 5.4 Feedback and Communication  
Continuous communication and iterative validation are key to the success of this engagement. Oracle and **Tecnotree** will maintain feedback loops via:

- Weekly progress check-ins
- Shared tracking documents (status reports, action logs)

- Local Peering Gateways (LPGs): Not used
- Route tables: Default route table for VCN
- Security lists: Security list for public subnet, security list for private subnet
- NSGs: NSG for public subnet, NSG for private subnet



 2. Compute

- Data encryption approach: Encryption in transit and at rest using SSL/TLS
- Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup: Logging Analytics for log collection and analysis


# 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
The primary principle for High Availability (HA) in OCI is to ensure that applications and services are always available and accessible, even in the event of component failures or outages. This is achieved through the use of redundant components, load balancing, and automatic failover. Another key principle is to ensure that data is always available and can be recovered in case of a disaster, through the use of backups, replication, and disaster recovery planning.

- **OKE**: Use of Node Pools distributed across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) or Fault Domains (FDs) to ensure resilience against hardware or AD failures.
- **Database Services (e.g., Autonomous Database, PostgreSQL)**: Explain how features like standby databases, replicas, or Autonomous Data Guard are used for HA/DR.
- **Object Storage**: Describe cross-region replication setup to maintain data durability in case of regional failures.
- **Networking & DNS**: Use of Traffic Management policies in OCI DNS for active-active or active-passive failover scenarios.
- **Backup & Restore**: Outline backup policies and the RPO/RTO objectives achieved.
- **DR Strategy Summary**: Provide an overview of the architecture’s DR design, including region failover strategies, recovery time expectations, and testing procedures.
