 Project Framework

This project is part of Oracle's ISV Validation Program, aimed at validating Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on OCI. The framework includes:
- **Lift & Shift Approach**: Migrate the existing containerized application to OCI without major code changes.
- **OCI-Native Optimization**: Leverage managed services for **scalability**, **high availability (HA)**, and **security**.
- **Automation**: Use Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to enable repeatable deployments and CI/CD readiness.
- **Testing**: Functional validation, performance benchmarking, and security assessments.
- **Best Practices**: Adherence to OCI Well-Architected Framework, emphasizing cost optimization, reliability, and operational excellence.

The project will be executed in OCI ISV Labs tenancy, with access provided to Tecnotree via Bastion for secure collaboration.


 Required Contribution From Client

Tecnotree is expected to provide:
- Detailed documentation of the current Digital BSS Solution architecture, including container manifests, database schemas, and networking requirements.
- Access to application source code, Docker images, and Kubernetes YAML files for Lift & Shift.
- Sample data sets for functional testing (e.g., BSS transaction simulations).
- Participation in workshops and testing sessions (at least 4 hours per week).
- Feedback on architecture proposals and validation results within 2 business days.
- Any proprietary tools or scripts needed for application deployment.


 Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs

Oracle will deliver:
- Validated target OCI architecture diagram and documentation.
- Terraform scripts for automated provisioning of the OCI environment.

- Security audit summary with recommendations.
- Final validation report, including lessons learned and migration roadmap.
- Access to the provisioned OCI environment for Tecnotree's review (valid for 30 days post-project).


 Cloud Environment Used

The validation will use an OCI ISV Labs tenancy in the Ashburn region (us-ashburn-1). Key configurations:
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartment for the project (e.g., tecnotree-bss-validation).
- **Shapes**: E5 shapes for compute instances (e.g., VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs and 64 GB RAM for general workloads).
- **Networking**: Single VCN with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) for HA.
- **Security**: IAM policies, Bastion for access, and WAF for web traffic protection.
- **Budget**: Capped at $5,000 in OCI credits for the validation period.


 Tecnotree Company Profile

Tecnotree is a global provider of digital business support systems (BSS) for telecom operators. With over 40 years of experience, Tecnotree offers solutions for customer management, billing, and service provisioning. Their Digital BSS Solution is a containerized platform designed for telco environments, supporting microservices architecture on Kubernetes. Tecnotree aims to leverage cloud-native technologies for enhanced **scalability** and **HA** in multi-cloud setups.


 In-Scope Application: Digital BSS Solution Validation

The Digital BSS Solution is a containerized application suite for telecom BSS operations, including customer relationship management (CRM), order management, and billing. It runs on Kubernetes with dependencies on databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra), streaming (for real-time events), and caching. This validation will assess its deployment on OCI using a Lift & Shift from on-premises or other clouds, focusing on OCI-native integrations for **security**, **HA**, and **scalability**.

 Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# Networking
- **VCN**: Single VCN (10.0.0.0/16) with public (10.0.0.0/24) and private (10.0.1.0/24) subnets across 3 ADs for HA.
- **Load Balancer**: Flexible shape, backend sets targeting OKE services on port 443 with health checks.
- **VPN**: Site-to-Site IPSec VPN with dynamic routing (BGP) for on-premises connectivity.
- **Bastion**: Ephemeral Bastion host in public subnet for secure access to private resources.


# Compute
- **Instances**: VM.Standard.E5.Flex shapes with 4 OCPUs, 64 GB RAM, used for non-containerized components like MongoDB/Cassandra nodes.
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling groups configured for workload spikes.


# Storage
- **Block Storage**: 1 TB volumes with 60 VPUs/GB for high IOPS, attached to Compute for database persistence.
- **File Storage**: 500 GB file system with snapshots for backups, mounted via NFS to OKE pods.


# Container Services
- **OKE**: Cluster with 3 worker nodes (E5 shapes), Kubernetes v1.28, integrated with Container Registry for image pulls.
- **OCI Streaming**: Stream pools with 10 partitions for BSS event processing.
- **Container Registry**: Private repository for Digital BSS images, with vulnerability scanning enabled.


# IAM & Security
- **IAM**: Policies like "Allow group TecnotreeAdmins to manage all-resources in compartment tecnotree-bss-validation".
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall policy with rules for SQL injection and XSS protection.


# Deployment Automation
- **Terraform**: Modules for provisioning VCN, OKE, databases, and storage. Example: oci_core_volume resource for Block Storage. Supports CI/CD integration with tools like GitHub Actions.


 Security Considerations

Security is paramount, following OCI best practices:
- **Least Privilege**: IAM policies restrict access (e.g., read-only for testing users).
- **Encryption**: Data at rest encrypted with OCI Vault keys; in-transit via TLS 1.3.
- **Network Security**: NSGs to allow only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for Load Balancer, 22 for Bastion).
- **Threat Protection**: WAF for web threats; Bastion for zero-trust access; vulnerability scanning in Container Registry.
- **Auditing**: OCI Logging and Audit for monitoring IAM actions and API calls.
- **Compliance**: Alignment with ISO 27001; recommendations for secrets management using OCI Vault.


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

The architecture ensures **HA** and DR tailored to services:
- **Compute & OKE**: Deploy across multiple ADs/FDs with auto-scaling; OKE control plane is managed with 99.95% SLA.
- **Storage**: Block Storage replicas across ADs; File Storage snapshots for point-in-time recovery.
- **Load Balancer & WAF**: Regional resources with automatic failover; traffic management steering for blue-green deployments.
- **Databases**: MySQL Database Service with automated backups and HA pairs; MongoDB/Cassandra on OKE with replication sets across ADs.
- **OCI Cache & Streaming**: Multi-AD deployment for redundancy; Streaming with message durability.
- **Networking**: VCN peering and VPN redundancy; Bastion with session timeouts.
- **DR Strategy**: Cross-region replication for critical data (e.g., using OCI Object Storage); RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour via automated backups and Terraform for quick reprovisioning.


 Closing Feedback

This validation demonstrates the Digital BSS Solution's readiness for OCI, highlighting benefits in **scalability**, **HA**, and automation. Feedback from Tecnotree on the process and outcomes is welcomed to refine future collaborations.
