# 15. Current State Architecture
The current architecture of the WERX application consists of an on-premise OpenShift environment with 6 nodes (3 masters, 3 workers), PostgreSQL database, and Kafka for messaging. The application is developed using Java and Docker.
- **Diagram Description**: The current setup includes K8s clusters, Kafka, DB, and Java-based application components.
- **Tech Stack**: Docker, Helm, PostgreSQL, Java, Kafka
- **Known Issues/Pain Points**: Manual deployments, scaling issues, and limited monitoring capabilities.

---


# 16. Target OCI Architecture
The target architecture for the WERX application on OCI will utilize the following services:
- Openshift Cluster for container orchestration
- GPU VM for simulation workloads
- Oracle 19c on IaaS for database services
**Service Mapping**:
| Current Service | Target OCI Service |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| On-premise OpenShift | Openshift Cluster  |
| Simulation Workloads | GPU VM            |
| PostgreSQL       | Oracle 19c on IaaS |
**Component Interaction**: The Openshift Cluster will manage the deployment and scaling of the WERX application containers. The GPU VM will be used for simulation workloads, and Oracle 19c on IaaS will provide database services.
**Diagram Placeholder**: The target architecture diagram will include the Openshift Cluster, GPU VM, Oracle 19c on IaaS, and the WERX application components, showcasing their interactions and data flows.

---


# 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings
- **Openshift Cluster**: Will be provisioned with 3 master nodes and 3 worker nodes, using the Oracle-provided OpenShift template.
- **GPU VM**: Will be configured with 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, 16 CPU cores, and 64 GB of memory.
- **Oracle 19c on IaaS**: Will be provisioned with a single instance, using the Oracle-provided database template.
- **Helm/Terraform usage**: Terraform will be used for infrastructure provisioning, and Helm will be used for application deployment.
- **OKE Node Pools config**: Node pools will be configured with 3 worker nodes, using the Oracle-provided OKE template.
- **PostgreSQL shape, version**: Oracle 19c on IaaS will be used, with a shape of VM.Standard.E2.1.
- **Streaming configuration**: Kafka will be configured with 3 brokers, using the Oracle-provided Kafka template.
- **Object Storage for backups or Helm registry**: Object Storage will be used for backups, with a bucket named "werx-backups".

---


# 18. Security Considerations
- **IAM Policy examples**: Policies will be created to restrict access to the WERX application and its components.
- **NSG configuration**: NSGs will be configured to allow incoming traffic to the Openshift Cluster and GPU VM.
- **Data encryption approach**: Data at rest will be encrypted using Oracle's encryption services, and data in transit will be encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup**: Audit logs will be enabled for the WERX application, and Logging Analytics will be used for log analysis.

---


# 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
- **OKE NodePools across ADs**: Node pools will be distributed across 3 availability domains.
- **PostgreSQL HA with replica**: A replica of the Oracle 19c database will be created, using Oracle's Data Guard.
- **Object Storage cross-region replication**: Object Storage will be configured to replicate data across 2 regions.
- **DNS failover via Traffic Management**: Traffic Management will be used to route traffic to the available instance of the WERX application.
- **DR architecture summary**: The DR architecture will include a secondary region, with a standby instance of the WERX application.
