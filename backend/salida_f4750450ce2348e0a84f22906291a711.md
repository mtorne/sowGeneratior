 Project Framework

This Statement of Work (SoW) outlines the collaboration between Oracle ISV Labs and dd for the validation of the ddd application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The project focuses on demonstrating the application's performance, scalability, and high availability (HA) using OCI-native services, including ddd (e.g., Compute with E5 shapes, Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE), Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), and Object Storage).  

The validation will be conducted as a Proof of Concept (PoC) in a non-production environment, emphasizing OCI best practices for security, automation via Terraform, and CI/CD readiness. The project duration is estimated at 4-6 weeks, subject to client contributions and milestone achievements.

---


 Required Contribution From Client

dd is expected to provide the following to ensure project success:  
- Access to ddd application source code, container images (e.g., Dockerfiles), and deployment scripts.  
- Detailed documentation of the current on-premises or legacy cloud architecture, including network diagrams and security policies.  
- Technical resources for joint workshops, such as application architects and DevOps engineers.  
- Test data sets and workloads to simulate realistic usage scenarios (e.g., load testing for scalability).  
- Feedback on deliverables within 3 business days of receipt.  
- Any necessary licenses or third-party dependencies for the ddd application.

---


 Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs

Oracle ISV Labs will deliver:  
- A fully configured OCI environment replicating the target architecture for ddd validation.  
- Terraform scripts for infrastructure automation and CI/CD pipeline templates (e.g., using OCI DevOps).  
- Validation report including performance metrics, HA failover tests, and scalability benchmarks.  
- Architectural diagrams and best practices guide for OCI-native deployment.  
- Knowledge transfer sessions on OCI services (ddd), security configurations, and automation.  
- Post-validation recommendations for production migration.

---


 Cloud Environment Used

The validation will utilize an OCI tenancy provided by Oracle ISV Labs under the ISV validation program. Key details:  
- **Region:** US Ashburn (us-ashburn-1) for primary setup, with optional cross-region replication for DR testing.  
- **Compartment:** Dedicated compartment named "ddd-validation" for resource isolation.  
- **Access:** Client will be granted read-only access via OCI Console and CLI; elevated privileges for joint sessions.  
- **Cost Management:** All resources will be provisioned under Oracle's sponsorship; no costs to dd.

 dd Company Profile

dd is a leading provider of innovative software solutions, specializing in [insert industry, e.g., telecommunications and enterprise applications]. With a focus on scalable, cloud-agnostic architectures, dd develops applications like ddd to address [e.g., data processing and analytics needs]. The company seeks to validate ddd on OCI to leverage its high-performance compute (e.g., E5 shapes), container orchestration, and native security features for enhanced reliability and cost efficiency.

---


 In-Scope Application: ddd

ddd is a containerized application stack designed for [e.g., real-time data processing and analytics]. It includes microservices for [e.g., API gateways, databases, and worker nodes], currently deployed on [e.g., on-premises Kubernetes or another cloud]. The validation will focus on migrating and optimizing ddd for OCI, emphasizing scalability (auto-scaling pods), HA (multi-AD deployment), and security (e.g., OCI Vault integration).

---


 Project Overview


# Validation Summary
This project validates the ddd application on OCI using services such as ddd (e.g., Compute with VM.Standard.E5.Flex shapes, OKE for container management, VCN for networking, and Object Storage for data persistence). The overview (ddd) involves replicating a containerized setup, performing load tests, and ensuring OCI-native integration for security and automation.


# Desired Outcome
- Demonstrate ddd running efficiently on OCI with improved performance metrics (e.g., 20% faster response times using E5 shapes).  
- Validate HA and DR capabilities, ensuring <5 minutes failover.  
- Provide Terraform-automated blueprints for scalable, repeatable deployments.  
- Prepare ddd for production-scale OCI adoption with CI/CD readiness.


# Scope
The project is a time-bound PoC to validate core functionalities, not a full production migration.

---


 Scope (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope)

**In-Scope:**  
- Provisioning and configuration of OCI resources for ddd (e.g., OKE cluster with E5 node pools).  
- Application deployment, testing for scalability (e.g., auto-scaling), HA, and security.  
- Automation using Terraform and basic CI/CD setup.  
- Performance benchmarking against current state.

**Out-of-Scope:**  
- Custom application code modifications or debugging.  
- Integration with non-OCI services or legacy systems.  
- Production data migration or compliance certifications (e.g., PCI-DSS).  
- Ongoing support post-validation.

 Current State Architecture

The current deployment of ddd is on [e.g., on-premises servers or AWS], using [e.g., self-managed Kubernetes, virtual machines, and local storage]. Key components include:  
- **Compute:** Standard VMs with limited scaling.  
- **Networking:** Basic VPC with manual firewall rules.  
- **Storage:** Local disks prone to single points of failure.  
- **Challenges:** Limited HA (no multi-zone), manual deployments, and security vulnerabilities (e.g., no centralized secrets management).

---


 Target OCI Architecture

The target architecture leverages OCI-native services (ddd) for an optimized, scalable, and secure deployment of ddd. It uses VM.Standard.E5.Flex shapes for flexible compute resources, OKE for container orchestration, VCN for isolated networking, and Object Storage for durable data.


# Service Mapping

| Current Component | OCI Service (ddd) | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| VMs/Servers      | Compute (VM.Standard.E5.Flex) | High-performance, burstable CPU for workloads; scalability via auto-scaling. |
| Kubernetes Cluster | Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) | Managed container orchestration with OCI-native integration for HA across Availability Domains (ADs). |
| Network          | Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) | Secure, isolated networking with subnets, security lists, and internet gateways. |
| Storage          | Object Storage & Block Volume | Durable, scalable storage with automatic backups and replication. |


# Component Interaction
- OKE pods on E5 shapes interact with Block Volumes for persistent data.  
- VCN routes traffic securely to OKE via Load Balancers.  
- Terraform automates provisioning, enabling CI/CD pipelines for updates.


# Diagram Placeholder
[Insert architectural diagram here: e.g., Visio or Draw.io representation showing VCN with subnets in multiple ADs, OKE cluster, Compute instances, and Object Storage buckets. For Markdown, describe: Central VCN connected to OKE (in AD1 and AD2 for HA), with arrows to Compute nodes and storage.]

 Security Considerations

Security is paramount in this OCI-native architecture. Best practices include:  
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Dynamic groups and policies to enforce role-based access; multi-factor authentication (MFA) for console users.  
- **Encryption:** Data at rest encrypted with OCI-managed keys; in-transit via TLS 1.3.  
- **Monitoring and Logging:** OCI Logging and Monitoring integrated for threat detection; alerts on anomalies (e.g., via OCI Security Zones).  
- **Compliance:** Adherence to OCI best practices, including Web Application Firewall (WAF) for ddd endpoints and Bastion for secure access.  
- **Vulnerability Management:** Regular scans using OCI Vulnerability Scanning Service on E5 instances and OKE images.

---


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

The HA/DR strategy is tailored to ddd services, leveraging OCI's regional and domain-level redundancy:  
- **HA Patterns:** Deploy OKE across multiple ADs/FDs to avoid single points of failure; auto-scaling groups for Compute (E5 shapes) with load balancing.  
- **Failover:** Traffic management via OCI Load Balancer with health checks; <1 minute detection and rerouting.  
- **Backups and Replication:** Automated backups for Block Volumes and Object Storage; cross-region replication for DR (e.g., to Phoenix region).  
- **Testing:** Simulated failover tests during validation to ensure RTO <5 minutes and RPO <1 hour.  
- **Scalability Integration:** Auto-scaling policies tied to OCI Monitoring metrics for dynamic resource adjustment.
