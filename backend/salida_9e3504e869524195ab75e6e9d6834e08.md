 5. Project Framework
Oracle and Tecnotree will collaborate closely in a joint validation project to ensure the seamless migration and optimization of Tecnotree's Digital BSS Solution on OCI. This partnership leverages Oracle's cloud expertise and Tecnotree's application domain knowledge to achieve mutual goals such as enhanced performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

Responsibility areas are clearly defined: Oracle will handle OCI infrastructure provisioning, architecture design, and best-practice guidance, while Tecnotree provides application-specific requirements, testing scenarios, and feedback on functionality. Feedback loops will include weekly status meetings, iterative reviews of deployment artifacts, and shared access to a collaborative workspace for real-time updates.

The expected validation duration is 2-3 weeks, focusing on rapid prototyping and testing to minimize disruption. This timeframe allows for thorough assessment while accelerating time-to-value.

Key objectives include validating compatibility with OCI services, identifying optimization opportunities, and building a foundation for future production deployments. This collaboration not only validates technical feasibility but also strengthens the strategic alliance between Oracle and Tecnotree, paving the way for innovative telecom solutions in the cloud.


 6. Required Contribution From Client
Tecnotree must provide the following to ensure project success:
- **Technical resources**: Dedicated personnel (e.g., architects and developers) for joint sessions, application deployment, and testing.
- **Diagrams or architectural artifacts**: Current state architecture diagrams, data flow models, and container manifests for the Digital BSS Solution.
- **Access to dev/test environment**: Credentials and endpoints for on-premises or existing cloud setups, including sample data sets and test scripts for validation.


 7. Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs
Oracle ISV Labs will provide:
- **Terraform modules**: Reusable code for automated provisioning of OCI resources, including OKE clusters and networking.
- **Target architecture in OCI**: Detailed diagrams and descriptions of the optimized setup using specified services.
- **Technical documentation**: Comprehensive guides on deployment, configuration, and best practices for integration.
- **CI/CD integration examples**: Sample pipelines using OCI Container Registry and Terraform for automated application deployments, if relevant to the validation scope.


 8. Cloud Environment Used
The PoC will run in a **Temporary Test Tenancy** provided by Oracle for the duration of the validation. This ensures a controlled, isolated environment without impacting Tecnotree's production systems. If Tecnotree is already onboarded, migration to the client tenancy can be considered post-validation.

 11. Project Overview
**Validation Summary**: Validation of Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using a Lift & Shift approach. The goal is to assess the compatibility of the existing containerized application architecture (Kubernetes, OKE) with OCI’s managed services, including database, storage, networking, and security. The validation will include functional testing, automated deployment using Terraform, and the definition of a target OCI architecture based on best practices.  
**Project Dates**: Kick-off Version Date: May 28, 2025  
Latest Update / Current Version: June 4, 2025  
Estimated Project Duration: 2–3 weeks

- **Desired outcome**: To be provided by Tecnotree and then agreed together with Oracle. If the SoW is filled in separately, Tecnotree can add the desired outcome and then synch with Oracle. Any change in the objectives and scope of the work will require mutual agreement between Tecnotree and Oracle.
- **Scope boundaries**: Initial understanding of the scope - needs to be validated with Tecnotree. Replicating the customer’s environment in a pay-as-you-go tenancy in Frankfurt to enable functional testing of Tecnotree's containerized Kubernetes setup. The focus is on a lift-and-shift approach without managed services, using a 6-node OKE cluster and supporting components like databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra) and UI servers, with specific latency and connectivity needs.
- **Joint goals**: Successfully validate Tecnotree's application stack in a replicated, containerized environment on OCI that mirrors the customer’s setup. This includes ensuring functional compatibility, performance within latency requirements, and readiness for future automation or cloud-native enhancements—ultimately enabling a smooth lift-and-shift migration path for customer environments. Demonstrate that OCI can reliably host Tecnotree’s containerized workloads in a way that matches customer requirements, including performance, scalability, and connectivity (e.g., to external systems).


 12. Scope
**In-Scope Items**:
- Deployment and configuration of OKE for containerized workloads.
- Integration with MySQL Database Service, MongoDB, and Cassandra for data persistence.
- Setup of OCI Streaming for real-time data processing.
- Networking via VCN, Load Balancer, WAF, Bastion, and VPN.
- Storage using Block Storage and File Storage.
- Caching with OCI Cache and image management via Container Registry.
- IAM for access control.
- Functional testing of the Digital BSS Solution in OCI.

**Out-of-Scope Items**:
- Production migration or data transfer.
- Licensing setup for third-party software.
- SLA support or 24/7 monitoring.
- Advanced customizations beyond lift-and-shift.

**Validation boundaries and limitations**: Limited to non-production testing in a single region; no performance benchmarking against on-premises; assumes Tecnotree provides container images.

 15. Current State Architecture
**Diagram Description**: The current setup includes on-premises Kubernetes clusters managing microservices, with Kafka for streaming, PostgreSQL/relational DBs for core data, and NoSQL stores like MongoDB/Cassandra for unstructured data. UI servers connect via load balancers, with manual VPN for external access.

**Tech Stack**: Docker for containerization, Helm for deployments, PostgreSQL/Java for backend, Kafka for messaging.

**Known Issues/Pain Points**: Manual deployments leading to downtime, scaling limitations in on-premises hardware, high latency in hybrid connectivity, and lack of automated backups.


 16. Target OCI Architecture
The target architecture migrates Tecnotree's Digital BSS Solution to OCI using a lift-and-shift approach, leveraging **OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)** for container orchestration, **Compute** for VMs, **Block Storage** and **File Storage** for persistent data, **Load Balancer** and **WAF** for traffic management and security, **OCI Cache** for performance, **MySQL Database Service**, **MongoDB**, and **Cassandra** for databases, **OCI Streaming** for real-time processing, **Container Registry** for images, **Bastion** and **VPN** for secure access, **VCN** for networking, and **IAM** for identity.

**Service Mapping Table**:

| Current Component       | OCI Service                  | Purpose                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Kubernetes Cluster      | OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) | Managed container orchestration |

 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# 1. Networking
- **VCN design, CIDRs, Subnets**: VCN with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16; public subnet (10.0.0.0/24) for Load Balancer, private subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for OKE and databases; 3-5 specs: Regional subnets across ADs for HA, dynamic routing.
- **Internet/NAT Gateways, Service Gateways**: Internet Gateway for public access, NAT for private outbound, Service Gateway for OCI services integration.
- **Local Peering Gateways (LPGs)**: LPG for cross-VCN peering if multi-tenancy needed.
- **Route tables, security lists, NSGs**: Route tables direct traffic to gateways; NSGs restrict ports (e.g., 443 for WAF, 6443 for OKE API); Security Lists at subnet level for broad controls.


# 2. Compute
- **VM shapes and OCPUs/memory**: VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs/64 GB RAM for general workloads; scalable to 64 OCPUs for high-demand nodes.
- **OS and images used**: Oracle Linux 8 for base images, customized with application dependencies.
- **Bastion/jump hosts**: Bastion host using VM.Standard.E5.Flex (1 OCPU/16 GB) for secure SSH access to private resources.
- **GPU instances (if any)**: Not applicable; standard E5 shapes used for all.


# 3. Storage
- **Block Volumes, Object Storage**: Block Storage volumes (100 GB, 60 VPUs) attached to Compute/OKE for persistent data; Object Storage for backups.
- **Boot volume size and configuration**: 50 GB boot volumes with encryption enabled; auto-tuned performance.
- **File Storage**: NFS-based File Storage (1 TB) for shared application files, mounted to OKE pods.


# 4. Container Services
- **OKE deployment process**: Cluster creation via OCI Console or Terraform; 6-node setup with worker nodes in multiple ADs.
- **Integration with OCI**: Use Container Registry for pushing/pulling images; OCI Cache for session data; OCI Streaming for pod logs.
- Additional: Helm charts for app deployment; autoscaling enabled for node pools.


# 5. IAM & Security
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartments for networking, compute, storage, and databases to isolate resources.
- **IAM policies**: Policies allowing OKE to access Container Registry (e.g., allow group OKE-Admins to manage repos).
- **Use of resource tags**: Tags for cost tracking (e.g., Project: BSS-Validation) and access control.
- **Access control via NSGs or Security Lists**: NSGs for fine-grained rules (e.g., allow ingress on port 3306 for MySQL from OKE subnet).


# 6. Deployment Automation
- **Terraform/Resource Manager usage**: Terraform modules for provisioning VCN, OKE, Load Balancer; Resource Manager stacks for orchestration.
- **CLI or Console steps**: OCI CLI for initial setup (e.g., oci network vcn create); Console for WAF policy configuration.
- **ISO upload, Assisted Installer**: Not applicable; focus on OKE native deployment with Terraform.

📌 **Additional Notes**: Deployment sequence starts with VCN, followed by Compute/Bastion, then OKE and databases, integrating via IAM. Inter-service: OKE pods use VPN for external connectivity; WAF protects Load Balancer endpoints. Concise for cloud architecture docs.


 18. Security Considerations
- **IAM Policy examples**: Dynamic group for OKE nodes with policy: "Allow dynamic-group OKE-Nodes to manage volume-family in compartment BSS-Compartment."
- **NSG configuration**: NSG rules allowing TCP 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 to Load Balancer, restricting internal traffic (e.g., MySQL port 3306 only from OKE subnet).
- **Data encryption approach**: Encryption at rest using OCI Vault keys for Block Storage, File Storage, and databases; in-transit via TLS 1.2 for all services.
- **Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup**: Enable OCI Logging for audit trails; integrate with Logging Analytics for centralized monitoring of IAM events and WAF logs.


 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
High Availability (HA) in OCI is achieved by distributing resources across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) and Fault Domains (FDs) to mitigate single points of failure. Disaster Recovery (DR) focuses on data replication and failover mechanisms to ensure business continuity with defined RPO/RTO.

- **OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)**: Node pools distributed across 3 ADs/FDs for resilience; etcd backups and pod anti-affinity for workload distribution.
- **Database Services (e.g., MySQL Database Service, MongoDB, Cassandra)**: MySQL uses Active Data Guard for standby replicas across ADs (OCI-managed); MongoDB/Cassandra replicas in multi-AD setups for HA; multi-AD deployment where applicable for automated failover.
- **Block Storage, File Storage**: Cross-AD replication for volumes; automated backups with 1-hour RPO.
- **Load Balancer, WAF**: Active-active setup across ADs with health checks for failover.
- **OCI Streaming, OCI Cache**: Multi-AD distribution; data replication for Streaming topics.
- **Networking & DNS (VCN, VPN, Bastion)**: VCN subnets spanned across ADs; VPN redundancy with dual tunnels.
- **Backup & Restore**: Policy-based backups for Compute, databases, and storage with RTO <4 hours, RPO <1 hour.
- **DR Strategy Summary**: Architecture supports region failover via cross-region replication (e.g., for Streaming/Object Storage backups); expected RTO 4-8 hours, RPO 1 hour; testing via simulated failover drills.
