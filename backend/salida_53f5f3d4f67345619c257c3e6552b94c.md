 Current State Architecture

The current xrp architecture is on-premises or legacy cloud, utilizing virtual machines for application servers, traditional databases for transaction storage, and manual deployment processes. Key components include:  
- Application servers handling processing logic.  
- Relational database for data persistence.  
- Limited scalability, with manual scaling and no native HA features.  
Challenges: High maintenance overhead, lack of automation, and vulnerability to downtime.


 Target OCI Architecture

The target architecture modernizes xrp by adopting an OCI-native design, emphasizing containerization for agility, autonomous operations for databases, and virtualized compute for flexibility. This enables scalability, security, and HA while preparing for Terraform-driven automation and CI/CD pipelines.


# Usage of OCI Services
- **OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine):** Hosts containerized xrp application pods, enabling auto-scaling and orchestration.  
- **Compute:** Provides VM instances (e.g., E5 shapes like VM.Standard.E5.Flex) for non-containerized components, such as auxiliary services or batch processing.  
- **ATP (Autonomous Transaction Processing):** Manages the database layer with automatic tuning, backups, and scaling for transaction-heavy workloads.


# Service Mapping Table

| xrp Component | Current Implementation | Target OCI Service | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Application Logic | On-premises VMs | OKE | Containerization for scalability and portability. |
| Auxiliary Services | Manual scripts on servers | Compute (E5 shapes) | Flexible VM resources with OCI-native integration. |
| Database | Traditional RDBMS | ATP | Autonomous management, auto-scaling, and built-in HA. |


# Component Interaction
- xrp pods in OKE interact with ATP via OCI Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) private endpoints for secure data access.  
- Compute instances provide supporting roles, such as API gateways, communicating with OKE via load balancers.  
- Terraform automates provisioning, ensuring CI/CD readiness for updates.


# Diagram Placeholder

*Description:* A high-level diagram showing OKE clusters in a VCN, connected to ATP instances across Availability Domains (ADs), with Compute VMs in a separate subnet. Load balancers manage traffic, and OCI IAM secures access.


 Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# Networking
- **VCN Setup:** Single VCN with public and private subnets; CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16.  
- **Security Lists:** Ingress/egress rules restricting traffic to OKE nodes and ATP endpoints.  
- **Load Balancers:** OCI Load Balancer for OKE services, configured with health checks.


# Compute
- **Instance Types:** VM.Standard.E5.Flex shapes with 4 OCPUs and 64 GB RAM for scalability.  
- **Configuration:** Boot volumes with 100 GB, attached to OKE worker nodes; auto-scaling groups for workload spikes.


# Storage
- **Block Volumes:** Used for persistent storage in Compute instances; encrypted with OCI Vault keys.  
- **Object Storage:** For backups and logs, integrated with ATP auto-backup features.


# Container Services
- **OKE Cluster:** Version 1.28, with 3 worker nodes (E5-based); pod security policies enabled.  
- **Helm Charts:** For deploying xrp containers, with auto-scaling via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).


# IAM & Security
- **Policies:** Least-privilege IAM policies granting OKE access to ATP.  
- **Vault Integration:** Secrets management for database credentials.


# Deployment Automation
- **Terraform Modules:** Custom modules for OKE provisioning, Compute instance creation, and ATP setup; state stored in OCI Object Storage.  
- **CI/CD Readiness:** Integration with OCI DevOps for pipeline automation, supporting Git-based deployments.


 Security Considerations

Security is prioritized through OCI best practices:  
- **Encryption:** Data at rest encrypted using OCI Vault; in-transit via TLS 1.3.  
- **Identity Management:** Dynamic groups and policies for OKE-to-ATP access without static credentials.  
- **Monitoring:** OCI Logging and Monitoring for threat detection; integration with OCI Security Zones.  
- **Compliance:** Alignment with standards like SOC 2, with ATP's autonomous security patching.


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

The HA/DR strategy is tailored to OKE, Compute, and ATP, leveraging OCI's regional and domain-level redundancy:  
- **OKE HA:** Clusters span multiple Fault Domains (FDs) within an Availability Domain (AD); auto-scaling and node pools for failover.  
- **Compute HA:** Instances distributed across ADs/FDs; use of OCI Auto Scaling Configurations for dynamic resource allocation.  
- **ATP HA:** Automatic backups to Object Storage; cross-region replication for DR; built-in failover with minimal RTO/RPO (e.g., 60 seconds failover).  
- **Traffic Management:** OCI Traffic Management Steering Policies for global load balancing and failover.  
- **DR Testing:** Simulated failover scenarios during validation, ensuring scalability under load.


 Closing Feedback

This SoW provides a comprehensive plan for validating and modernizing xrp on OCI. Feedback from cegid is welcomed to refine details. Upon approval, we can proceed to implementation, ensuring a successful deployment in August 2025.
