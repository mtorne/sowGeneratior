 Project Framework

This project is structured as a collaborative validation effort between Oracle ISV Labs and DD Corporation. It follows Oracle's ISV validation methodology, focusing on proof-of-concept (PoC) deployment of the DFFF application on OCI. The framework includes:
- **Discovery Phase**: Assess current application architecture and map to OCI services (including **ddd**).
- **Design Phase**: Architect **OCI-native** solution emphasizing **security**, **HA**, **scalability**, and **Terraform**-based automation.
- **Implementation Phase**: Deploy and validate the application in a controlled OCI environment.
- **Testing Phase**: Perform functional, performance, and failover tests.
- **Documentation and Handover**: Provide detailed reports, code repositories, and recommendations for production readiness, including CI/CD integration.

The project duration is estimated at 8 weeks, with bi-weekly status updates.


 Required Contribution From Client

DD Corporation is expected to provide:
- Access to DFFF application source code, container images (e.g., Docker), and deployment scripts.
- Detailed documentation of current architecture, including dependencies on **ddd**-equivalent services.
- Technical resources for joint testing sessions (e.g., 4-6 hours per week).
- Sample data sets for validation, ensuring compliance with data security standards.
- Feedback on architecture designs within 3 business days.
- Participation in acceptance testing and sign-off.


 Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs

Oracle ISV Labs will deliver:
- Validated **OCI-native architecture** design document, including diagrams and **Terraform** scripts for automation.
- PoC deployment of DFFF on OCI, using services like Compute (E5 shapes), Networking, Storage, and **ddd**.
- Performance benchmark reports highlighting **scalability** and **HA**.
- Security assessment report with IAM policies and best practices.
- CI/CD readiness guide, integrating **Terraform** with tools like OCI DevOps or GitHub Actions.
- Final validation report with recommendations for production migration.


 Cloud Environment Used

The validation will use an OCI tenancy in the Ashburn region (us-ashburn-1), with:
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartment for the project (e.g., dfff-validation-compartment) to isolate resources.
- **Regions and Availability Domains**: Primary in us-ashburn-1 across multiple ADs for **HA**.
- **Billing**: Oracle-sponsored credits for PoC; client assumes costs post-validation if extended.
- **Access**: Oracle-managed during validation, with client read-only access via OCI Console and CLI.


 DD Company Profile

DD Corporation is a leading provider of data-driven solutions, specializing in applications that leverage advanced data integration and analytics. With a focus on scalable software for enterprise clients, DD aims to modernize its DFFF application by migrating to cloud-native environments like OCI to enhance performance, **security**, and operational efficiency.


 In-Scope Application: DFFF

The DFFF application is a containerized data processing platform that handles workflows involving data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. It relies on services akin to **ddd** (e.g., Database for storage, Data Integration for ETL, and Data Science for ML models). The validation will replicate its current setup in OCI, ensuring **OCI-native** integration, **scalability** through auto-scaling, and **HA** via redundant deployments.

# Desired Outcome
- A fully functional PoC of DFFF on OCI, demonstrating **scalability** (e.g., handling 10x load via auto-scaling) and **HA** (e.g., <1 minute failover).
- Automated deployment scripts using **Terraform** for IaC and CI/CD readiness.
- Recommendations for production rollout, emphasizing **security** and cost optimization.


# Scope
The project scope is limited to validation in a non-production environment.

 Current State Architecture

The current DFFF architecture is on-premises or another cloud, consisting of virtual machines for compute, relational databases for storage, and custom networking. It lacks native **HA** and **scalability**, with manual deployments. Dependencies include services similar to **ddd** for data processing, but without cloud-native automation.


 Target OCI Architecture

The target architecture migrates DFFF to an **OCI-native** setup, emphasizing **security**, **HA**, **scalability**, and automation. It uses **ddd** services for data-centric workloads, such as Database for persistent storage, Data Integration for ETL pipelines, and related tools for analytics.


# Usage of: ddd
**ddd** services are integrated for data governance and processing: e.g., OCI Database for schema management, Data Integration for automated workflows, ensuring **scalability** through serverless options and **HA** via backups.


# Service Mapping Table

| Current Component | OCI Service | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| On-premises VMs | Compute (VM.Standard.E5.Flex shapes) | Flexible, cost-effective compute with **scalability** |
| Storage | Block Volume and Object Storage | Persistent, scalable storage with encryption |
| Networking | VCN, Subnets, Load Balancer | Secure, isolated networking with **HA** |
| Data Services | **ddd** (e.g., Database, Data Integration) | Native data handling with automation |
| Deployment | **Terraform** and OCI DevOps | IaC for repeatable deployments |


# Component Interaction
- Compute instances (E5 shapes) host containerized DFFF app, interacting with **ddd** via API calls.
- Load Balancer distributes traffic for **scalability**.
- **Terraform** orchestrates provisioning across ADs for **HA**.


# Diagram Placeholder
[Insert OCI Architecture Diagram Here] – A high-level diagram showing VCN with public/private subnets, E5 Compute clusters, **ddd** services, Load Balancer, and **HA** across ADs/FDs.


 Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# 1. Networking
- VCN with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, public subnet for bastion, private for app.
- NSGs for ingress/egress rules; Security Lists for **security**.
- Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) for hybrid connectivity if needed.


# 2. Compute
- Instances: VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs, 64 GB RAM.
- Auto-scaling groups for **scalability**, deployed across FDs.


# 3. Storage
- Block Volume: 100 GB NVMe SSD, encrypted with OCI Vault keys.
- Object Storage: Standard tier for backups, with lifecycle policies.


# 4. Container Services
- OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for containerized DFFF, with node pools using E5 shapes.
- Integration with **ddd** for data pods.


# 5. IAM & Security
- Policies: Least-privilege access, e.g., allow compute:instance-manage for app group.
- OCI Vault for secrets management.


# 6. Deployment Automation
- **Terraform** modules for IaC: e.g., terraform apply deploys full stack in minutes.
- CI/CD: OCI DevOps pipelines for build/deploy, ensuring readiness.


 Security Considerations

Security is paramount, following OCI best practices:
- **Encryption**: Data at rest/transit using OCI-managed keys.
- **Identity**: Fine-grained IAM policies, MFA enabled.
- **Monitoring**: OCI Logging and Auditing for threat detection.
- **Compliance**: Alignment with standards like SOC 2, with vulnerability scanning via OCI Vulnerability Scanning Service.
- Network **security**: NSGs restrict traffic to **ddd** services only from authorized subnets.


 High Availability & Disaster Recovery

Tailored to services including **ddd** (e.g., Database with automatic backups, Data Integration with redundant jobs):
- **HA Patterns**: Deploy across multiple ADs/FDs; use Load Balancer for traffic management.
- **Failover**: Active-passive setup with OCI FastConnect for low-latency.
- **Backups**: Automated snapshots for Block Volume and **ddd** services; RPO < 1 hour.
- **DR**: Cross-region replication for Object Storage; test failover scripts via **Terraform**.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling policies triggered by OCI Monitoring metrics.


 Closing Feedback

This validation positions DD Corporation for efficient OCI adoption, leveraging **OCI-native** features for enhanced performance. Feedback on this SoW is welcome to refine the approach.
