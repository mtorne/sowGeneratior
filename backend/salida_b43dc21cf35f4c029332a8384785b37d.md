 5. Project Framework
This collaboration between Oracle and Tecnotree follows a structured validation process for the Digital BSS Solution on OCI. Oracle will lead the architecture design, deployment, and validation using OCI best practices, while Tecnotree provides application-specific expertise, artifacts, and testing support. Responsibility areas include: Oracle handling OCI infrastructure setup and automation (e.g., Terraform), and Tecnotree providing application code, configurations, and functional testing. Feedback loops involve weekly status calls and shared documentation via Oracle's collaboration tools. The expected validation duration is 2-3 weeks, focusing on lift-and-shift compatibility, with potential extensions for iterative refinements based on mutual agreement.


 6. Required Contribution From Client
Tecnotree must provide the following to ensure successful validation:
- **Technical resources**: Dedicated personnel (e.g., architects and developers) for collaboration, including access to SMEs for application-specific queries.
- **Diagrams or architectural artifacts**: Current state architecture diagrams, data flow models, and container manifests (e.g., Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments).
- **Access to dev/test environment**: Credentials or VPN access to on-prem/dev setups for replication, application images/dockerfiles, and test data/scripts for functional validation.


 7. Expected Deliverables From Oracle ISV Labs
Oracle will deliver:
- **Terraform modules**: Custom modules for automated deployment of the target OCI architecture, including OKE clusters, networking, and storage.
- **Target architecture in OCI**: A validated reference architecture diagram and configuration for Digital BSS Solution on OCI.
- **Technical documentation**: Detailed setup guides, deployment sequences, and best practices for integration with listed OCI services.
- **CI/CD integration examples**: Sample pipelines using OCI Container Registry and Terraform for automated application deployments, if relevant to the validation scope.


 8. Cloud Environment Used
The PoC will run in a **Temporary Test Tenancy** provisioned by Oracle in the Frankfurt region (eu-frankfurt-1) for pay-as-you-go testing. This isolates the validation from production environments and allows easy teardown post-project. If Tecnotree is already onboarded, migration to their tenancy can be considered upon request.

 11. Project Overview
**Validation Summary**: Validation of Tecnotree’s Digital BSS Solution on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using a Lift & Shift approach. The goal is to assess the compatibility of the existing containerized application architecture (Kubernetes, OKE) with OCI’s managed services, including database, storage, networking, and security. The validation will include functional testing, automated deployment using Terraform, and the definition of a target OCI architecture based on best practices.

**Project Dates**:
- Kick-off Version Date: May 28, 2025
- Latest Update / Current Version: June 4, 2025
- Estimated Project Duration: 2–3 weeks

**Project Team**:
- **Oracle Team**:
  - Heikki Ridanpaa – Account Cloud Engineer
  - Maria Solvsteen – Sales Representative
  - Marc Torné – Cloud Solution Architect
  - Laura Taunasescu – Service Delivery Manager
- **Tecnotree Team**:
  - Markus Kivilä – Senior Enterprise Architect
  - Suhail Thusu – Director – Technology Alliances

- **Desired outcome**: To be provided by Tecnotree and then agreed together with Oracle. If the SoW is filled in separately, Tecnotree can add the desired outcome and then synch with Oracle. Any change in the objectives and scope of the work will require mutual agreement between Tecnotree and Oracle.
- **Initial understanding of the scope** - needs to be validated with Tecnotree: Replicating the customer’s environment in a pay-as-you-go tenancy in Frankfurt to enable functional testing of Tecnotree's containerized Kubernetes setup. The focus is on a lift-and-shift approach without managed services, using a 6-node OKE cluster and supporting components like databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra) and UI servers, with specific latency and connectivity needs.
- **Desired outcome of Tecnotree**: Successfully validate their application stack in a replicated, containerized environment on OCI that mirrors the customer’s setup. This includes ensuring functional compatibility, performance within latency requirements, and readiness for future automation or cloud-native enhancements—ultimately enabling a smooth lift-and-shift migration path for customer environments.
- **Desired Outcome, as jointly agreed with Oracle**: Demonstrate that OCI can reliably host Tecnotree’s containerized workloads in a way that matches customer requirements, including performance, scalability, and connectivity (e.g., to external systems via VPN).
- **Scope boundaries**: Limited to non-production validation; no custom development or production support.
- **Joint goals**: Achieve a validated reference architecture for OCI deployment, with documented performance metrics and migration guidelines.


 12. Scope
- **In-Scope Items**:
  - Deployment and configuration of OKE for Kubernetes workloads.
  - Setup of MySQL Database Service, MongoDB (via Compute), Cassandra (via Compute) for data persistence.
  - Integration with OCI Streaming for messaging, Block/File Storage for volumes, Load Balancer and WAF for traffic management.
  - Networking via VCN, VPN, Bastion; security with IAM; caching with OCI Cache; image management via Container Registry.
  - Functional testing of lift-and-shift scenarios, including Terraform automation.
- **Out-of-Scope Items**:
  - Production migration or data transfer from on-prem.
  - Licensing setup for third-party tools (e.g., MongoDB/Cassandra licenses).
  - SLA support, advanced performance tuning, or custom application code changes.
- **Validation boundaries and limitations**: Testing limited to Frankfurt region; assumes Tecnotree provides compatible container images; no load testing beyond basic functional validation.

 15. Current State Architecture
- **Diagram Description**: The current setup includes on-prem Kubernetes clusters managing containerized BSS components, with Kafka for streaming, relational (MySQL-like) and NoSQL (MongoDB/Cassandra) databases for data storage, and load-balanced UI servers connected via VPN to external systems. Data flows from streaming sources to databases via application pods.
- **Tech Stack**: Docker for containerization, Helm for deployments, Java/Spring Boot for core logic, MySQL for transactions, MongoDB/Cassandra for scalable data, Kafka for messaging.
- **Known Issues/Pain Points**: Manual deployments leading to downtime, scaling challenges in on-prem clusters, high latency in hybrid connectivity, and limited automation for provisioning.


 16. Target OCI Architecture
The target architecture lifts and shifts Tecnotree's Digital BSS Solution to OCI, leveraging managed services for scalability, security, and HA. **Compute** provides VM instances (E5 shapes) for non-containerized components like MongoDB/Cassandra. **OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)** hosts the core containerized application with automated node management. **Block Storage** and **File Storage** offer persistent volumes for databases and shared files. **Load Balancer** distributes traffic, protected by **WAF** for web security. **OCI Cache** accelerates data access. **MySQL Database Service** manages relational data. **MongoDB** and **Cassandra** run on Compute VMs with clustering. **OCI Streaming** handles messaging. **Container Registry** stores images. **Bastion** enables secure access, **VPN** connects to on-prem, all within a **VCN** secured by **IAM**.

- **Service Mapping Table**:

| Current Component      | OCI Service Mapping                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Kubernetes Cluster     | OKE                                  |
| Relational DB          | MySQL Database Service               |
| NoSQL DBs              | MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute         |
| Messaging              | OCI Streaming                        |
| Storage                | Block Storage, File Storage          |
| Networking/Security    | VCN, VPN, Bastion, IAM, Load Balancer, WAF |

- **Component Interaction**: Application pods in OKE access MySQL via private endpoints, stream data via OCI Streaming to MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute, with Load Balancer routing external traffic through WAF. OCI Cache fronts frequent queries. Bastion and VPN provide secure ingress/egress within VCN.
- **Diagram Placeholder**: Text layout - VCN enclosing: Public Subnet (Load Balancer + WAF) -> Private Subnet (OKE Cluster with pods -> MySQL DB Service, Compute VMs for MongoDB/Cassandra, OCI Cache, OCI Streaming) -> Storage (Block/File attached to OKE/Compute) -> Bastion in public subnet -> VPN Gateway for on-prem connectivity. IAM policies control access across compartments.


 17. Implementation Details and Configuration Settings


# 1. Networking
- **VCN design, CIDRs, Subnets**: Single VCN with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16; public subnet (10.0.0.0/24) for Load Balancer/Bastion; private subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for OKE/Compute; regional subnets across 3 ADs for HA.
- **Internet/NAT Gateways, Service Gateways**: Internet Gateway for public access; NAT Gateway for private outbound; Service Gateway for OCI services like Object Storage/Container Registry.
- **Local Peering Gateways (LPGs)**: LPG for potential multi-VCN peering if scaling to DR region.
- **Route tables, security lists, NSGs**: Default route table routes 0.0.0.0/0 to NAT/Internet; NSGs restrict OKE to port 443 for API, MySQL to 3306; security lists allow VPN traffic on IPsec ports.


# 2. Compute
- **VM shapes and OCPUs/memory**: VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs/64 GB RAM for MongoDB/Cassandra nodes; scalable to 8 OCPUs for load.
- **OS and images used**: Oracle Linux 8 for all instances; custom images from Container Registry for app-specific setups.
- **Bastion/jump hosts**: Bastion service with session-based access; E5 shape VM as jump host in public subnet.
- **GPU instances (if any)**: None required; standard E5 shapes suffice for this validation.


# 3. Storage
- **Block Volumes, Object Storage**: 100 GB Block Volumes attached to Compute for MongoDB/Cassandra data (encrypted, 1000 VPUs for performance); Object Storage for backups/logs.
- **Boot volume size and configuration**: 50 GB boot volumes for Compute VMs, with auto-tune performance.
- **File Storage**: NFS-based File Storage (100 GB) mounted to OKE pods for shared application files, replicated across ADs.


# 4. Container Services
- **OKE deployment process**: Deploy 6-node OKE cluster via OCI Console/Terraform; use Helm for app deployment.
- **Integration with OCI**: Push images to Container Registry; use Resource Manager for stack deployment; integrate with OCI Streaming for pod events.


# 5. IAM & Security
- **Compartments**: Dedicated compartment for OKE/Compute; separate for databases/storage.
- **IAM policies (optional)**: Policies allowing OKE to access Container Registry (e.g., allow group OKE-Admins to manage repos).
- **Use of resource tags**: Tags for cost tracking (e.g., Project: Tecnotree-BSS) and automation.
- **Access control via NSGs or Security Lists**: NSGs for fine-grained control (e.g., allow only OKE to MySQL on 3306); encryption keys managed via Vault.


# 6. Deployment Automation
- **Terraform/Resource Manager usage**: Terraform modules for VCN, OKE, MySQL provisioning; Resource Manager stacks for one-click deployment.
- **CLI or Console steps (if any)**: OCI CLI for initial setup (e.g., oci network vcn create); Console for WAF policy config.
- **ISO upload, Assisted Installer**: Not applicable; use OCI-native tools for OKE.

**Additional Notes**: Deployment sequence: 1) Provision VCN/VPN/Bastion; 2) Deploy Compute and Storage; 3) Set up OKE and Container Registry; 4) Configure databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra); 5) Integrate Load Balancer/WAF/OCI Cache/Streaming; 6) Apply IAM. Inter-service integration includes OKE pods mounting Block Storage via CSI driver and accessing OCI Streaming via SDK.


 18. Security Considerations
- **IAM Policy examples**: Dynamic group for OKE nodes with policy: "Allow dynamic-group OKE-Nodes to read repos in tenancy" for Container Registry access; user groups with least-privilege for Bastion sessions.
- **NSG configuration**: Stateful NSGs allowing ingress from Load Balancer to OKE on port 80/443; egress to MySQL on 3306; VPN traffic on 500/4500 UDP.
- **Data encryption approach**: KMS-managed keys for Block/File Storage encryption at rest; TLS 1.2+ for in-transit (e.g., MySQL connections); WAF for OWASP protection.
- **Audit logs or Logging Analytics setup**: Enable OCI Logging for all services; route to Logging Analytics for centralized querying and alerts on security events.


 19. High Availability & Disaster Recovery
High Availability (HA) in OCI is achieved by distributing resources across multiple Availability Domains (ADs) or Fault Domains (FDs) within a region, ensuring no single point of failure. Disaster Recovery (DR) leverages cross-region replication and failover mechanisms to meet RPO/RTO objectives, with automated backups and testing.

- **OKE**: Node pools distributed across 3 ADs/FDs for resilience; auto-scaling and self-healing pods ensure 99.95% uptime.
- **Database Services (e.g., MySQL Database Service, MongoDB, Cassandra)**: MySQL uses managed HA with automatic failover to standby in another AD (OCI-managed); MongoDB/Cassandra on Compute with replicas across ADs for manual failover; multi-AD deployment for low-latency HA.
- **Block Storage, File Storage**: Cross-AD replication for volumes; automatic backups with 1-hour RPO.
- **Load Balancer**: Active-active across ADs with health checks for failover.
- **OCI Streaming**: Multi-AD topics for HA; cross-region replication for DR.
- **Networking & DNS**: VCN with redundant gateways; VPN with dual tunnels for HA.
- **Backup & Restore**: Automated daily backups for MySQL/Storage with 4-hour RTO; manual restore testing.
- **DR Strategy Summary**: Active-passive DR to secondary region (e.g., Amsterdam) with data replication via Object Storage sync; failover in <1 hour via Terraform; annual testing to validate RPO=0 (streaming) and RTO=4 hours.
