  Reserved IPs are IPs which already registered using VCN API.

  Create a reserved Public IP and then while creating the load balancer pass the ocid of the reserved IP in this
  * field reservedIp to attach the Ip to Load balancer. Load balancer will be configured to listen to traffic on this IP.
  * <p>
  Reserved IPs will not be deleted when the Load balancer is deleted. They will be unattached from the Load balancer.
