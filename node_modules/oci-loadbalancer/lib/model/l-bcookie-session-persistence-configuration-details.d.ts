/**
* The configuration details for implementing load balancer cookie session persistence (LB cookie stickiness).
* <p>
Session persistence enables the Load Balancing service to direct all requests that originate from a single logical
* client to a single backend web server. For more information, see
* [Session Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Balance/Reference/sessionpersistence.htm).
* <p>
When you configure LB cookie stickiness, the load balancer inserts a cookie into the response. The parameters configured
* in the cookie enable session stickiness. This method is useful when you have applications and Web backend services
* that cannot generate their own cookies.
* <p>
Path route rules take precedence to determine the target backend server. The load balancer verifies that session stickiness
* is enabled for the backend server and that the cookie configuration (domain, path, and cookie hash) is valid for the
* target. The system ignores invalid cookies.
* <p>
To disable LB cookie stickiness on a running load balancer, use the
* {@link #updateBackendSet(UpdateBackendSetRequest) updateBackendSet} operation and specify {@code null} for the
* {@code LBCookieSessionPersistenceConfigurationDetails} object.
* <p>
Example: {@code LBCookieSessionPersistenceConfigurationDetails: null}
* <p>
**Note:** {@code SessionPersistenceConfigurationDetails} (application cookie stickiness) and {@code LBCookieSessionPersistenceConfigurationDetails}
* (LB cookie stickiness) are mutually exclusive. An error results if you try to enable both types of session persistence.
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.
*

      * The name of the cookie inserted by the load balancer. If this field is not configured, the cookie name defaults
  * to \"X-Oracle-BMC-LBS-Route\".
  * <p>
  Example: {@code example_cookie}
  * <p>
  **Notes:**
  * <p>
  *  Ensure that the cookie name used at the backend application servers is different from the cookie name used
  *    at the load balancer. To minimize the chance of name collision, Oracle recommends that you use a prefix
  *    such as \"X-Oracle-OCI-\" for this field.
  * <p>
  *  If a backend server and the load balancer both insert cookies with the same name, the client or browser
  *    behavior can vary depending on the domain and path values associated with the cookie. If the name, domain,
  *    and path values of the {@code Set-cookie} generated by a backend server and the {@code Set-cookie} generated by the
  *    load balancer are all the same, the client or browser treats them as one cookie and returns only one of
  *    the cookie values in subsequent requests. If both {@code Set-cookie} names are the same, but the domain and path
  *    names are different, the client or browser treats them as two different cookies.

      * The domain in which the cookie is valid. The {@code Set-cookie} header inserted by the load balancer contains a
  * domain attribute with the specified value.
  * <p>
  This attribute has no default value. If you do not specify a value, the load balancer does not insert the domain
  * attribute into the {@code Set-cookie} header.
  * <p>
  **Notes:**
  * <p>
  *  [RFC 6265 - HTTP State Management Mechanism](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt) describes client and
  *    browser behavior when the domain attribute is present or not present in the {@code Set-cookie} header.
  * <p>
     If the value of the {@code Domain} attribute is {@code example.com} in the {@code Set-cookie} header, the client includes
  *    the same cookie in the {@code Cookie} header when making HTTP requests to {@code example.com}, {@code www.example.com}, and
  *    {@code www.abc.example.com}. If the {@code Domain} attribute is not present, the client returns the cookie only for
  *    the domain to which the original request was made.
  * <p>
  *  Ensure that this attribute specifies the correct domain value. If the {@code Domain} attribute in the {@code Set-cookie}
  *    header does not include the domain to which the original request was made, the client or browser might reject
  *    the cookie. As specified in RFC 6265, the client accepts a cookie with the {@code Domain} attribute value {@code example.com}
  *    or {@code www.example.com} sent from {@code www.example.com}. It does not accept a cookie with the {@code Domain} attribute
  *    {@code abc.example.com} or {@code www.abc.example.com} sent from {@code www.example.com}.
