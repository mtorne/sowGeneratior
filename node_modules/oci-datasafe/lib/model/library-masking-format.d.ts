/**
* A library masking format is a masking format stored in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compartment and can be used in
* multiple masking policies. If you want to use the same masking logic for multiple masking columns or even in multiple
* masking policies, you can create a library masking format and assign it to masking columns as needed. It helps you
* avoid defining the same masking logic again and again.
* <p>
Oracle Data Safe provides a set of predefined library masking formats to mask common sensitive and personal data,
* such as names, national identifiers, credit card numbers, and phone numbers. To meet your specific requirements, you
* can easily create new library masking formats and use them in your masking policies.
