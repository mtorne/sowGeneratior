 * The Random Digits masking format generates random digits of length within a range.
 * The length range is defined by the startLength and endLength attributes. The start
 * length must be less than or equal to the end length. When masking columns with
 * uniqueness constraint, ensure that the length range is sufficient enough to generate
 * unique values. This masking format pads to the appropriate length in a string, but
 * does not pad when used for a number column. It's a complementary type of Random Number,
 * which is not padded.
