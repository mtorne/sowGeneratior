/**
* The Deterministic Encryption (Date) masking format encrypts column data using a cryptographic
* key and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). It can be used to encrypt date columns only.
* It requires a range of dates as input defined by the startDate and endDate attributes. The
* start date must be less than or equal to the end date.
* <p>
The original column values in all the rows must be within the specified date range. The
* encrypted values are also within the specified range. Therefore, to ensure uniqueness, the
* total number of dates in the range must be greater than or equal to the number of distinct
* original values in the column. If an original value is not in the specified date range, it
* might not produce a one-to-one mapping. All non-confirming values are mapped to a single
* encrypted value, thereby producing a many-to-one mapping.
* <p>
Deterministic Encryption (Date) is a format-preserving, deterministic and reversible masking
* format, which requires a seed value while submitting a masking work request. Passing the
* same seed value when masking multiple times or masking different databases ensures that
* the data is masked deterministically. To learn more, check Deterministic Encryption in the
* Data Safe documentation.
