  * 2. minutes = <mm> (So, the allowed range for <mm> is [0, 59])
  * 3. hours = <hh> (So, the allowed range for <hh> is [0, 23])
  * <day-of-week> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1(Monday) and 7(Sunday))
  * 4. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of week must equal the given value
  * <day-of-month> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1 and 28)
  * 5. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of month must equal the given value
