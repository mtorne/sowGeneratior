/**
* The details of WebAppFirewallPolicy. A policy is comprised of rules, which allows executing inspections of
* incoming/outgoing HTTP message parameters and execution of actions, based on results of rules execution.
* <p>
In policy, rules are grouped into modules by their functionality. Modules can be further divided by the type
* of HTTP messages they handle:
*   Modules that inspect incoming HTTP request. These modules are executed in the order they are enumerated here:
*     * requestAccessControl
*     * requestRateLimiting
*     * requestProtection
* <p>
 Modules that inspect outgoing HTTP responses. These modules are executed in the order they are enumerated here:
*    * responseAccessControl
*    * responseProtection
