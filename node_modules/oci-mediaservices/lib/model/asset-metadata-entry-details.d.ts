/**
 * Media Services API
 * Media Services (includes Media Flow and Media Streams) is a fully managed service for processing media (video) source content. Use Media Flow and Media Streams to transcode and package digital video using configurable workflows and stream video outputs.

Use the Media Services API to configure media workflows and run Media Flow jobs, create distribution channels, ingest assets, create Preview URLs and play assets. For more information, see [Media Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/dms-mediaflow/home.htm) and [Media Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/dms-mediastream/home.htm).
