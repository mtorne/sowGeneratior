/**
 * Visual Builder API
 * Oracle Visual Builder enables developers to quickly build web and mobile applications. With a visual development environment that makes it easy to connect to Oracle data and third-party REST services, developers can build modern, consumer-grade applications in a fraction of the time it would take in other tools.
The Visual Builder Instance Management API allows users to create and manage a Visual Builder instance.
