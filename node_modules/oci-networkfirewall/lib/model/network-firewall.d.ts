 * A network firewall is a security resource that exists in a subnet of your choice and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules. Each firewall is associated with a policy. Traffic is routed to and from the firewall from resources such as internet gateways and dynamic routing gateways (DRGs).
