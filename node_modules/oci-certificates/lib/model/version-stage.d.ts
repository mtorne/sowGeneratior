/**
 * A list of possible rotation states for the certificate version. A certificate version marked {@code CURRENT} is currently in use.
 * A certificate version marked {@code PENDING} is staged and available for use, but has not been applied on the target system and, therefore, has not been rotated into current, active use.
 * The certificate most recently uploaded to the service is always marked {@code LATEST}.
 * (The first version of a certificate is always marked as both {@code CURRENT} and {@code LATEST}.)
 * A certificate version marked {@code PREVIOUS} is the certificate version that was most recently marked {@code CURRENT}, before the last certificate version rotation.
 * A certificate version marked {@code DEPRECATED} is neither current, pending, nor the previous one in use. Only certificate versions marked {@code DEPRECATED} can be scheduled for deletion.
