 * **NOTES:**
 * *  If you do not specify any access control rules, the default rule is to allow all traffic.
 * *  If you add access control rules, the load balancer denies any traffic that does not match the rules.
 * *  Maximum of two match conditions can be specified in a rule.
 * *  You can specify this rule only with the following {@code RuleCondition} combinations:
 * *  {@code SOURCE_IP_ADDRESS}
 * *  {@code SOURCE_VCN_ID}
 * *  {@code SOURCE_VCN_ID}, {@code SOURCE_VCN_IP_ADDRESS}
