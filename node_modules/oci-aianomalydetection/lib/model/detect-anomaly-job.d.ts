/**
 * Anomaly Detection API
 * OCI AI Service solutions can help Enterprise customers integrate AI into their products immediately by using our proven,
pre-trained/custom models or containers, and without a need to set up in house team of AI and ML experts.
This allows enterprises to focus on business drivers and development work rather than AI/ML operations, shortening the time to market.
