/**
 * Identity Domains API
 * Use the Identity Domains API to manage resources within an identity domain, for example, users, dynamic resource groups, groups, and identity providers. For information about managing resources within identity domains, see [Identity and Access Management (with identity domains)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/home.htm).
Use this pattern to construct endpoints for identity domains: {@code https://<domainURL>/admin/v1/}. See [Finding an Identity Domain URL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/locate-identity-domain-url.htm) to locate the domain URL you need.
Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the Identity Domains API.

/**
 * A list of trusted User Agents owned by this user. Multi-Factored Authentication uses Trusted User Agents to authenticate users.  A User Agent is software application that a user uses to issue requests. For example, a User Agent could be a particular browser (possibly one of several executing on a desktop or laptop) or a particular mobile application (again, oneof several executing on a particular mobile device). A User Agent is trusted once the Multi-Factor Authentication has verified it in some way.
