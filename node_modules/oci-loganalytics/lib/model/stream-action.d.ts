      * The duration of data to be searched for SAVED_SEARCH tasks,

  Duration in ISO 8601 extended format as described in

  * The value should be positive.
  * The largest supported unit (as opposed to value) is D, e.g.  P14D (not P2W).

  There are restrictions on the maximum duration value relative to the task schedule
  * value as specified in the following table.
  *    Schedule Interval Range          | Maximum Duration
  * ----------------------------------- | -----------------
  *   5 Minutes     to 30 Minutes       |   1 hour  \"PT60M\"
  *  31 Minutes     to  1 Hour          |  12 hours \"PT720M\"
  *  1 Hour+1Minute to  1 Day           |   1 day   \"P1D\"
  *  1 Day+1Minute  to  1 Week-1Minute  |   7 days  \"P7D\"
  *  1 Week         to  2 Weeks         |  14 days  \"P14D\"
  *  greater than 2 Weeks               |  30 days  \"P30D\"
  * <p>
  If not specified, the duration will be based on the schedule. For example,
  * if the schedule is every 5 minutes then the savedSearchDuration will be \"PT5M\";
  * if the schedule is every 3 weeks then the savedSearchDuration will be \"P21D\".
