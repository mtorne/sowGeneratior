 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetricData, use the {@code telemetry-ingestion} endpoints; for all other operations, use the {@code telemetry} endpoints.
For more information, see
