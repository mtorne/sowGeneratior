* A TargetResponderRecipe resource contains a specific instance of one of the
* supported detector types (for example, activity, configuration, or threat)
* in which some settings can be modified specifically for a single target.
* <p>
A TargetResponderRecipe resource:
* * Is effectively a copy of a ResponderRecipe resource in which users can make
* very limited changes if it\u2019s Oracle-managed, and more changes if it\u2019s user-managed.
* * Is visible on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page.
* * Is located in a specific OCI compartment.
* * Can be modified by users, programmatically or through the UI.
* * Changes that can be made here override any settings in the corresponding
* ResponderRecipe, of which the TargetResponderRecipe resource is effectively a copy
* of the ResponderRecipe resource (effectively created when the detector recipe
* is attached to the target).
