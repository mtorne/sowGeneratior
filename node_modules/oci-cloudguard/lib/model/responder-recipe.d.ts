/**
* A ResponderRecipe resource contains a specific instance of one of
* the supported detector types (for example, activity, configuration,
* or threat).
* <p>
A ResponderRecipe resource:
* * Is effectively a copy of a Responder resource in which users can make
* very limited changes if it\u2019s Oracle-managed, and more changes if it\u2019s user-managed.
* * Can also be created by cloning an existing ResponderRecipe resource, either
* user-managed or Oracle-managed.
* * Is visible on Cloud Guard\u2019s Responder Recipes page.
* * Is located in a specific OCI compartment.
* * Can be modified by users, programmatically or through the UI.
* * Changes that can be made here apply globally, to resources in all OCI compartments
* mapped to a target that attaches the responder recipe, but are overridden by
* any changes made in the corresponding TargetResponderRecipe resource (effectively
* created when the responder recipe is attached to the target).
