/**
 * OperatorAccessControl API
 * Operator Access Control enables you to control the time duration and the actions an Oracle operator can perform on your Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
Using logging service, you can view a near real-time audit report of all actions performed by an Oracle operator.

Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the OperatorAccessControl API.

* While creating the operator control, specify how operator actions are approved and the users who have the privilege of approving the operator actions associated with the Operator Control.
* <p>
You must specify which operator actions must be pre-approved. The rest of the operator actions associated with the Operator Control will require an explicit approval from the users selected either through the approver groups or individually.
* <p>
You must name your Operator Control appropriately so it reflects the resources that will be governed by the Operator Control. Neither the Operator Controls nor their assignments to resources are visible to the Oracle operators.
