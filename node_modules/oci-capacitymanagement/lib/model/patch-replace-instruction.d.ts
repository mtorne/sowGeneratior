 * NOT_FOUND exceptions are handled by creating the implied containing structure (but note that this may put the target in an invalid state,
 * which can be prevented by use of precondition operations).
 * To avoid referential errors if an item's descendant is also in the selection, items of the selection are processed in order of decreasing depth.
