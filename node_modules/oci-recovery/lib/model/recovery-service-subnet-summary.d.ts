 * Each Recovery Service subnet uses a single private endpoint on a subnet of your choice within a VCN.
 * The private endpoint need not be on the same subnet as the Oracle Cloud Database, although, it must be on a subnet that can communicate with the Oracle Cloud Database.
 * To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator.
 * If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see Getting Started with Policies.
