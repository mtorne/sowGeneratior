/**
 * Replication targets are associated with a primary resource called a {@link Replication}
 * located in another availability domain in the same or different region.
 * The replication retrieves the delta of data between two snapshots of a source file system
 * and sends it to the associated {@code ReplicationTarget},  which applies it to the target
 * file system.
 * All operations (except {@code DELETE}) must be done using the associated replication resource.
 * Deleting a {@code ReplicationTarget} allows the target file system to be exported.
 * Deleting a {@code ReplicationTarget} does not delete the associated {@code Replication} resource, but places it in a {@code FAILED} state.
 * For more information, see [File System Replication](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/FSreplication.htm).
