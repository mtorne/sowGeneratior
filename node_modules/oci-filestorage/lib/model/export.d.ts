/**
* A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
* resource belongs to exactly one export set.
* <p>
The export's path attribute is not a path in the
* referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path
* component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file
* system.
* <p>
The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
* slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
* the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
* sequence for the first export resource can't contain the
* complete path element sequence of the second export resource.
* <p>

* For example, the following are acceptable:
* <p>
  * /example and /path
*   * /example1 and /example2
*   * /example and /example1
* <p>
The following examples are not acceptable:
*   * /example and /example/path
*   * / and /example
* <p>
Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
* or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.
* <p>
No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can
* reference the same file system.
* <p>
Use {@code exportOptions} to control access to an export. For more information, see
* [Export Options](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/exportoptions.htm).

  * set of clients.
  * <p>
  For each NFS request, the first {@code ClientOptions} option

  **Exports without defined {@code ClientOptions} are invisible to all clients.**

  If one export is invisible to a particular client, associated file
