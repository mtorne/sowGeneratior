/**
 * Dashboards API
 * Use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dashboards service API to manage dashboards in the Console.
Dashboards provide an organized and customizable view of resources and their metrics in the Console.
For more information, see [Dashboards](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Dashboards/home.htm).

**Important:** Resources for the Dashboards service are created in the tenacy's home region.
Although it is possible to create dashboard and dashboard group resources in regions other than the home region,
you won't be able to view those resources in the Console.
Therefore, creating resources outside of the home region is not recommended.
