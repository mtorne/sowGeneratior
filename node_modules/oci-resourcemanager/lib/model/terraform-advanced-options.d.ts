/**
 * Resource Manager API
 * Use the Resource Manager API to automate deployment and operations for all Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources.
Using the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) model, the service is based on Terraform, an open source industry standard that lets DevOps engineers develop and deploy their infrastructure anywhere.
For more information, see
[the Resource Manager documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/home.htm).
