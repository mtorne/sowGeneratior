     * The following are successful status values of individual attribute items in a bulk update attribute operation.
     * ATTRIBUTE_UPDATED - The attribute's properites have been updated with the given properties.
     * DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is a duplicate of an attribute that was present in this bulk request.  Note that we deduplicate the attribute collection, process only unique attributes,
     * and call out duplicates.  A duplicate attribute in a bulk request will not prevent the processing of further attributes in the bulk operation.
     * The following values are error statuses and the bulk processing is stopped when the first error is encountered.
     * INVALID_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is invalid.
     * ATTRIBUTE_NOT_PROCESSED - The attribute was not processed, as there was another attribute in this bulk request collection that resulted in a processing error.
     * ATTRIBUTE_DOES_NOT_EXIST - Attribute was neither active nor pinned inactive.
     * ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED - Attribute update is not allowed as it is an in-built system attribute.
