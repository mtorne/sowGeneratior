     * object.  The bulk operation will be successful only when all attributes in the bulk request are processed successfully and they get a success status back.
     * The following are successful status values of individual attribute items in a bulk attribute pin operation.
     * ATTRIBUTE_PINNED - The attribute is marked pinned and associated notes have been added.
     * ATTRIBUTE_ALREADY_PINNED - The caller is trying to pin an attribute that has already been pinned.
     * DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is a duplicate of an attribute that was present in this bulk request.  Note that we deduplicate the attribute collection, process only unique attributes,
     * and call out duplicates.  A duplicate attribute in a bulk request will not prevent the processing of further attributes in the bulk operation.
     * The following values are error statuses and the bulk processing is stopped when the first error is encountered.
     * PIN_NOT_ALLOWED - The caller has asked to pin an active attribute which is not allowed.
     * INVALID_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is invalid.
     * ATTRIBUTE_NOT_PROCESSED - The attribute was not processed, as there was another attribute in this bulk request collection that resulted in a processing error.
