     * ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED - The attribute is marked unpinned and associated notes have been cleared.
     * DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is a duplicate of an attribute that was present in this bulk request.  Note that we deduplicate the attribute collection, process only unique attributes,
     * and call out duplicates.  A duplicate attribute in a bulk request will not prevent the processing of further attributes in the bulk operation.
     * The following values are error statuses and the bulk processing is stopped when the first error is encountered.

     * ATTRIBUTE_NOT_PROCESSED - The attribute was not processed, as there was another attribute in this bulk request collection that resulted in a processing error.
