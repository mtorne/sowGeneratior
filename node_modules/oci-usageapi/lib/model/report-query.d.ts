/**
 * Usage API
 * Use the Usage API to view your Oracle Cloud usage and costs. The API allows you to request data that meets the specified filter criteria, and to group that data by the chosen dimension. The Usage API is used by [Cost Analysis](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm), [Scheduled Reports](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/scheduledreportoverview.htm), and [Carbon Emissions Analysis](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/emissions-management.htm) in the Console. Also see [Using the Usage API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm#cost_analysis_using_the_api) for more information.
