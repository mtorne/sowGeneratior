/**
 * An entity allows the labeler to identify an object in the record to label.  This can be, for example, a snippet of text, an entire image, or a bounding box within an image.  All entity types have an array of labels that are indexed. If more than one label is provided, but the annotationType on the corresponding dataset is for a single class, the API rejects the create annotation request.
