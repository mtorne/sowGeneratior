/**
 * An Apdex configuration rule.
 * The Apdex score is computed based on how the response time of a span compares to two predefined threshold values.
 * The first threshold defines the maximum response time that is considered satisfactory for the end user.
 * The second one defines the maximum response time that is considered tolerable. All times larger than that will
 * be considered frustrating for the end user.
 * An Apdex configuration rule works by selecting a subset of spans based on a filter expression and applying the
 * two threshold comparisons to compute a score for each of the selected spans.
 * The rule has an \"isApplyToErrorSpans\" property that controls whether or not to compute the Apdex for spans that
 * have been marked as errors. If this property is set to \"true\", then the Apdex score for error spans is computed in
 * the same way as for non-error ones. If set to \"false\", then computation for error spans is skipped, and the score
 * is set to \"frustrating\" regardless of the configured thresholds. The default is \"false\".
 * The \"isEnabled\" property controls whether or not an Apdex score is computed and can be used to disable Apdex
 * score for certain spans. The default is \"true\".
 * The \"priority\" property specifies the importance of the rule within a rule set.
 * Lower values indicate a higher priority. Rules with higher priorities are evaluated first in the rule set. The
 * priority of the rules must be unique within a rule set.
