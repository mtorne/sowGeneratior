      * The state of DNSSEC on the zone.
  * <p>
  For DNSSEC to function, every parent zone in the DNS tree up to the top-level domain (or an independent
  * trust anchor) must also have DNSSEC correctly set up.
  * After enabling DNSSEC, you must add a DS record to the zone's parent zone containing the
  * {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion} data. You can find the DS data in the {@code dsData} attribute of the {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}.
  * Then, use the {@code PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion} operation to promote the {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}.
  * <p>
  New {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}s are generated annually, a week before the existing {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}'s expiration.
  * To rollover a {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}, you must replace the parent zone's DS record containing the old
  * {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion} data with the data from the new {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion}.
  * <p>
  To remove the old DS record without causing service disruption, wait until the old DS record's TTL has
  * expired, and the new DS record has propagated. After the DS replacement has been completed, then the
  * {@code PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion} operation must be called.
  * <p>
  Metrics are emitted in the {@code oci_dns} namespace daily for each {@code KskDnssecKeyVersion} indicating how many
  * days are left until expiration.
  * We recommend that you set up alarms and notifications for KskDnssecKeyVersion expiration so that the
  * necessary parent zone updates can be made and the {@code PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion} operation can be called.
  * <p>
  Enabling DNSSEC results in additional records in DNS responses which increases their size and can
  * cause higher response latency.
  * <p>
  For more information, see [DNSSEC](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/dnssec.htm).
